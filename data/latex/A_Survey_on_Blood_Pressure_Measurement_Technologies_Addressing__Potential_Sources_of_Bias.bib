               elements of patient management. Arterial pressure is determined

               the blood flows out of the arteries. This review will discuss
               the three forces that determine the pressure in a vessel:
               elastic, kinetic, and gravitational energy. Emphasis will be
               placed on the importance of the distribution of arterial
               resistances, the elastance of the walls of the large vessels,
               and critical closing pressures in small arteries and arterioles.
               Regulation of arterial pressure occurs through changes in
               cardiac output and changes in vascular resistance, but these two
               controlled variables can sometimes conflict.",

               parameters in clinical medicine. For years, the cuff-based
               sphygmomanometer and the arterial invasive line have been the
               gold standards for care professionals to assess BP. During the
               past few decades, the wide spread of the oscillometry-based BP
               arm or wrist cuffs have made home-based BP assessment more
               convenient and accessible. However, the discontinuous nature,
               the inability to interface with mobile applications, the
               relative inaccuracy with movement, and the need for calibration
               have rendered those BP oscillometry devices inadequate for
               next-generation healthcare infrastructure where integration and
               continuous data acquisition and communication are required.
               Recently, the indirect approach to obtain BP values has been
               intensively investigated, where BP is mathematically derived
               through the ``Time Delay'' in propagation of pressure waves in

              hypertension. Blood viscosity values measured at six different
              shear rates were significantly correlated with blood pressure (r
              = 0.432 to 0.505, p less than 0.001). Blood viscosity was higher
              in hypertensive patients. This was due to both higher plasma
              viscosity (1.29 +/- 0.08 standard deviation versus 1.24 +/- 0.05
              centipoise (cPs), p less than 0.001) and increased hematocrit
              values (44.4 +/- 4 percent versus 41.5 +/- 3 percent, p less than
              0.005). When blood viscosity was evaluated in subgroups of normal
              and hypertensive subjects with matched hematocrit values, it
              remained higher in the hypertensive patients, and the
              relationship between blood pressure and viscosity was still
              significant. Regardless of the hematocrit value, fibrinogen
              levels were elevated in hypertensive patients (p less than 0.006)
              and, in association with the increased globulin concentration,
              fibrinogen was largely responsible for the increased plasma
              viscosity in hypertensive patients. Since the viscosity of
              defibrinated blood was similar in normal and hypertensive
              subjects with matched hematocrit values, the elevated fibrinogen
              level also affected whole blood viscosity. Defibrinated blood
              viscosity and arterial pressures were not correlated. These
              studies demonstrate a direct correlation between blood pressure
              and blood viscosity among normotensive and hypertensive subjects.
              This relationship is, in part, due to the rheologic effects of an
              elevated fibrinogen level and to an increased hematocrit value.
              The basis for hyperfibrinogenemia in hypertensive patients is

  abstract = "PURPOSE: To study the diameter response of retinal arterioles as
              a function of the arteriolar diameter. METHODS: Ten healthy young
              volunteers aged 22 to 33 years were subjected to diameter
              measurement of four successive segments of a retinal arteriole
              with a retinal vessel analyzer (RVA). At each of the segments,
              the diameter response during an increase in the systemic blood
              pressure (mean arterial pressure [MAP]) induced by isometric
              exercise was compared to the diameter of the arterioles during
              rest. RESULTS: The isometric exercise induced a significant
              contraction of the studied vessel segments averaging 2.5\% +/-
              0.4\% (P < 0.0001, n = 40). There was a significant negative

              segments and the diameter response induced by isometric exercise
              (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: The blood pressure-induced diameter
              response of retinal arterioles increased with decreasing diameter
              of the vessels. The results indicate that the distal retinal

               hypertension is critical. However, because of environmental
               issues, other alternatives are needed. Noninvasive BP
               measurement devices are largely divided into auscultatory and
               oscillometric types. The aneroid sphygmomanometer, the currently
               used auscultatory method, is inferior to MS in terms of
               limitations such as validation and regular calibration and
               difficult to apply to infants, in whom Korotkoff sounds are not
               audible. The oscillometric method uses an automatic device that
               eliminates errors caused by human observers and has the
               advantage of being easy to use; however, owing to its
               measurement accuracy issues, the development of an international
               validation protocol for children is important. The hybrid
               method, which combines the auscultatory and electronic methods,
               solves some of these problems by eliminating the observer bias
               of terminal digit preference while maintaining measurement
               accuracy; however, the auscultatory method remains limited. As
               the age-related characteristics of the pediatric group are
               heterogeneous, it is necessary to reconsider the appropriate BP
               measurement method suitable for this indication. In addition,
               the mobile application-based BP measurement market is growing
               rapidly with the development of smartphone applications.
               Although more research is still needed on their accuracy, many
               experts expect that mobile application-based BP measurement will
               effectively reduce medical costs due to increased ease of access

  title    = "Toward ubiquitous blood pressure monitoring via pulse transit
              time: Predictions on maximum calibration period and acceptable
              error limits",
  author   = "Mukkamala, Ramakrishna and Hahn, Jin-Oh",
  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Pulse transit time (PTT) is being widely pursued for
              ubiquitous blood pressure (BP) monitoring. PTT-based systems may
              require periodic cuff calibrations but can still be useful for
              hypertension screening by affording numerous out-of-clinic
              measurements that can be averaged. The objective was to predict
              the maximum calibration period that would not compromise accuracy
              and acceptable error limits in light of measurement averaging for
              PTT-based systems. METHODS: Well-known mathematical models and
              vast BP data were leveraged. Models relating PTT, age, and gender
              to BP were employed to determine the maximum time period for the
              PTT-BP calibration curve to change by 12 mmHg for systolic BP
              could achieve the screening accuracy of the cuff-based approach
              via measurement averaging. CONCLUSION: This theoretical study
              indicates that PTT-based BP monitoring is viable even with
              periodic calibration and seemingly high measurement errors.
              SIGNIFICANCE: The predictions may help guide the implementation,
              evaluation, and application of PTT-based BP monitoring systems in
              practice.",

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Wide pulse pressure (PP) affects the accuracy of
               oscillometric blood pressure measurements (OBPM): however, the
               degree of this impact on different patient groups with wide PPs
               is unclear. This study will investigate the accuracy of OBPM in
               achieving target BP and PP in isolated systolic hypertension
               (ISH) group compared with mixed hypertension (MHT) group.
               METHOD: A total of 115 patients (70 with ISH and 45 with MHT)
               were enrolled in the study. Upper arm and wrist OBPM, obtained
               by OmronM3 and OmronR6 devices respectively, were compared with
               the simultaneously measured values from the ascending aorta. The
               ISH was defined as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) > or =140
               mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) or =140 mmHg and a
               DBP> or =90 mmHg. RESULTS: The mean central arterial blood
               pressure (BP) and central PP were higher in the ISH group than
               those in the MHT group. The upper arm OBPM underestimated the
               central SBP in two groups (-5 mmHg, -3 mmHg, p=0.5,
               respectively), but overestimated DBP in the ISH group compared
               with MHT patients (6.8 mmHg, 1 mmHg, p=0.04, respectively).
               Wrist OBPM similarly underestimated to the central SBP in each
               group (-16 mmHg, -19 mmHg, p=0.15), whereas the sum of
               overestimation of DBP was significantly higher in the ISH than
               in the MHT group (+6 mmHg, - 1 mmHg, p=0.001, respectively).
               Also, each of the devices underestimated the central PP in the
               ISH group (about 10 mmHg) as being higher than that of the MHT
               group. CONCLUSION: Oscillometric devices may be used for self-BP
               measurement in patients with ISH without clinically important
               disadvantages compared with the patients with MHT. For PP
               measurement in patients with ISH, there were substantial
               differences between intra-arterial and indirect arm BP
               measurements.",

  abstract  = "Men are at greater risk for cardiovascular and renal disease
               than are age-matched, premenopausal women. Recent studies using
               the technique of 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
               have shown that blood pressure is higher in men than in women at
               similar ages. After menopause, however, blood pressure increases
               in women to levels even higher than in men. Hormone replacement
               therapy in most cases does not significantly reduce blood
               pressure in postmenopausal women, suggesting that the loss of
               estrogens may not be the only component involved in the higher
               blood pressure in women after menopause. In contrast, androgens
               may decrease only slightly, if at all, in postmenopausal women.
               In this review the possible mechanisms by which androgens may
               increase blood pressure are discussed. Findings in animal
               studies show that there is a blunting of the
               pressure-natriuresis relationship in male spontaneously
               hypertensive rats and in ovariectomized female spontaneously
               hypertensive rats treated chronically with testosterone. The key
               factor in controlling the pressure-natriuresis relationship is
               the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The possibility that
               androgens increase blood pressure via the RAS is explored, and
               the possibility that the RAS also promotes oxidative stress
               leading to production of vasoconstrictor substances and
               reduction in nitric oxide availability is proposed.",

               little is known about the longitudinal development of these
               differences. METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-four-hour ambulatory
               blood pressure was measured up to 12 times (5 times on average)
               over a 15-year period in 312 African Americans (AAs) and 351
               European Americans aged 7 to 30 years. Multivariate individual
               growth curves across age were created for daytime and nighttime
               blood pressure jointly. For both daytime and nighttime systolic
               blood pressure (SBP), AAs and males had higher levels (P<0.001)
               than European Americans and females. Males also showed a greater
               increase with age (P<0.001) than females. For nighttime SBP, a
               faster increase of SBP with age (P<0.01) in AAs was additionally
               observed. The ethnic difference in nighttime SBP levels and its
               increase with age were significantly larger than in daytime SBP.
               For daytime and nighttime diastolic blood pressure, AAs had
               higher levels than European Americans (P<0.001), and this
               difference was significantly larger at night. From late
               adolescence onward, males showed a greater increase in diastolic
               blood pressure with age than females. Ethnic and gender
               differences persisted after adjustment for height, body mass
               index, socioeconomic status, and stress-related coping styles.
               Family history of essential hypertension explained ethnic
               differences in daytime SBP. CONCLUSIONS: We observed significant
               ethnic and gender differences in longitudinal trajectories of
               ambulatory blood pressure in youth and young adults. The blunted
               nocturnal decline and its exacerbation with age in AAs
               corroborate and extend findings of cross-sectional studies.",

               cognitive impairment, and cognitive decline. Design, Setting,
               and Participants: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities
               prospective population-based cohort study enrolled 4761
               participants during midlife (visit 1, 1987-1989) and followed-up
               over 6 visits through 2016-2017 (visit 6). BP was examined over
               24 years at 5 in-person visits between visits 1 and 5
               (2011-2013). During visits 5 and 6, participants underwent
               detailed neurocognitive evaluation. The setting was 4 US
               communities: Washington County, Maryland; Forsyth County, North
               Carolina; Jackson, Mississippi; and Minneapolis, Minnesota.
               Follow-up ended on December 31, 2017. Exposures: Five groups
               based on longitudinal patterns of normotension, hypertension
               (>140/90 mm Hg), and hypotension (<90/60 mm Hg) at visits 1 to
               5. Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary outcome was dementia
               onset after visit 5, based on Ascertain Dementia-8 informant
               questionnaires, Six-Item Screener telephone assessments,
               hospital discharge and death certificate codes, and the visit 6
               neurocognitive evaluation. Secondary outcome was mild cognitive
               impairment at visit 6, based on the neurocognitive evaluation.
               Results: Among 4761 participants (2821 [59\%] women; 979 [21\%]
               black race; visit 5 mean [SD] age, 75 [5] years; visit 1 mean
               age range, 44-66 years; visit 5 mean age range, 66-90 years),
               there were 516 (11\%) incident dementia cases between visits 5
               and 6. The dementia incidence rate for participants with
               normotension in midlife (n = 833) and late life was 1.31 (95\%
               CI, 1.00-1.72 per 100 person-years); for midlife normotension
               and late-life hypertension (n = 1559), 1.99 (95\% CI, 1.69-2.32
               per 100 person-years); for midlife and late-life hypertension (n
               = 1030), 2.83 (95\% CI, 2.40-3.35 per 100 person-years); for
               midlife normotension and late-life hypotension (n = 927), 2.07
               (95\% CI, 1.68-2.54 per 100 person-years); and for midlife

               3.40-5.32 per 100 person-years). Participants in the midlife and
               late-life hypertension group (hazard ratio [HR], 1.49 [95\% CI,
               1.06-2.08]) and in the midlife hypertension and late-life
               hypotension group (HR, 1.62 [95\% CI, 1.11-2.37]) had
               significantly increased risk of subsequent dementia compared
               with those who remained normotensive. Irrespective of late-life
               BP, sustained hypertension in midlife was associated with
               dementia risk (HR, 1.41 [95\% CI, 1.17-1.71]). Compared with
               those who were normotensive in midlife and late life, only
               participants with midlife hypertension and late-life hypotension

               With low-dose antihypertensive drugs, however, the HBP reduction
               peaked in patients with a high pretreatment HBP, indicating the

               home (n=5297) blood pressure were measured in 17 921
               participants (51.3\% women; mean age, 54.2 years) from 17
               population cohorts. Subsequently, mortality and cardiovascular
               events were recorded. Using multivariable Cox regression,
               floating absolute risk was computed across 4 age bands
               ($\leq$60, 61-70, 71-80, and >80 years). Over 236 491
               person-years, 3855 people died and 2942 cardiovascular events
               occurred. From levels as low as 110/65 mm Hg, risk log-linearly
               increased with higher out-of-office systolic/diastolic blood
               pressure. From the youngest to the oldest age group, rates
               expressed per 1000 person-years increased (P<0.001) from 4.4
               (95\% CI, 4.0-4.7) to 86.3 (76.1-96.5) for all-cause mortality

               events, whereas hazard ratios per 20-mm Hg increment in systolic

               similar for out-of-office diastolic pressure and were generally
               consistent in both sexes and across ethnicities. In conclusion,
               adverse outcomes were directly associated with out-of-office
               blood pressure in adults. At young age, the absolute risk
               associated with out-of-office blood pressure was low, but

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: The aim was to compare short-term and long-term
               reproducibilities of in-office unattended blood pressure (BP),
               namely automated office blood pressure (AOBP), conventionally
               measured attended office BP, and self-measured home BP. METHODS:
               A multicentre, clinical study was conducted in Japan, and 287
               Japanese outpatients on antihypertensive drug medication were
               followed-up for 1 year. RESULTS: The intensity of drug treatment
               was sustained consistently throughout the study period (defined
               daily doses, 1.62-1.68; P = 0.12). The mean SBP differences
               between baseline and 1 month later, as well as baseline and 1
               year later, were less than 1.5 mmHg, whereas the standard
               deviations of the differences for home, AOBP, and attended
               office measurements for the 1-year interval were 7.7, 14.5, and
               15.3 mmHg, respectively. The coefficients of variation were
               significantly smaller for home BP than for AOBP among all
               patients at both 1-month and 1-year intervals (P < 0.0001). In
               the 1-month interval, partial correlation coefficients of home
               BP (r, 0.73/0.88 for systolic/diastolic measures) were
               significantly higher than of conventional BP (r, 0.47/0.69).
               However, the correlations converged to the modest level
               regardless of BP information (r, 0.49-0.54/0.63-0.73) when the
               1-year interval was assessed. Results were confirmatory when
               patients on the same drug regimen (n = 167) were analysed.
               CONCLUSION: A higher reproducibility of home BP was demonstrated
               compared with in-office BP, including AOBP. However, the modest
               correlations for the 1-year interval support the importance of
               regular assessment of BP, regardless of in-office or home
               measurements for treatment of hypertension.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The beach chair position that is commonly used in
               shoulder surgery is associated with relative hypovolemia, which
               leads to a reduction in arterial blood pressure. The effects of
               patient positioning on the accuracy of non-invasive continuous
               blood pressure monitoring with the ClearSight™ system (CS-BP;
               Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine CA, USA) have not been studied
               extensively. Our research aim was to assess agreement levels
               between CS-BP measurements with traditional blood pressure
               monitoring techniques. METHODS: For this prospective
               self-controlled study, we included 20 consecutively treated
               adult patients undergoing elective shoulder surgery in the beach
               chair position. We performed Bland-Altman analyses to determine
               agreement levels between blood pressure values from CS-BP and
               standard non-invasive (NIBP) methods. Perioperative measurements
               were done in both the supine (as reference) and beach chair
               surgical positions. Additionally, we compared invasive blood
               pressure (IBP) measurements with both the non-invasive methods
               (CS-BP and NIBP) in a sub-group of patients (n = 10) who
               required arterial blood pressure monitoring. RESULTS: We
               analyzed 229 data points (116 supine, 113 beach chair) from the
               entire cohort; per patient measurements were based on surgical
               length (range 3-9 supine, 2-10 beach chair). The mean difference
               ($\pm$SD; 95\% limits of agreement) in the mean arterial
               pressure (MAP) between CS-BP and NIBP was - 0.9 ($\pm$11.0; -
               24.0-22.2) in the beach chair position and - 4.9 mmHg
               ($\pm$11.8; - 28.0-18.2) when supine. In the sub-group, the
               difference between CS-BP and IBP in the beach chair position was
               - 1.6 mmHg ($\pm$16.0; - 32.9-29.7) and - 2.8 mmHg ($\pm$15.3; -
               32.8-27.1) in the supine position. Between NIBP and IBP, we
               detected a difference of 3.0 mmHg ($\pm$9.1; - 20.8-14.7) in the
               beach chair position, and 4.6 mmHg ($\pm$13.3; - 21.4-30.6) in
               the supine position. CONCLUSIONS: We found clinically acceptable
               mean differences in MAP measurements between the ClearSight™ and
               non-invasive oscillometric blood pressure systems when patients
               were in either the supine or beach chair position. For all
               comparisons of the monitoring systems and surgical positions,
               the standard deviations and limits of agreement were wide. TRIAL

               on blood pressure measurement in the sitting position. METHODS:
               Blood pressure of 128 individuals (the majority being treated
               hypertensive patients) visiting the outpatient clinic was
               measured simultaneously on both arms with arms in two different
               positions. First, both arms were placed at the chair support
               level and blood pressure was measured three times on both arms
               after 10 min of rest. Subsequently, while still remaining in the
               same sitting position, five blood pressure measurements were
               made simultaneously at both arms with one arm placed on the desk
               and one arm placed and supported at heart level (mid-sternal).
               The arm placed at heart level served as the reference arm. The
               choice of which arm was placed at desk level and which arm was
               placed at heart level was randomized. RESULTS: Both at desk
               level and at chair support level, mean (+/-SD) systolic and
               diastolic blood pressures were higher than blood pressure at
               heart level by 6.1/5.7+/-4.6/3.1 and 9.3/9.4+/-5.4/3.4 mmHg,
               respectively. The effect of the height differences between the
               arm positions on the blood pressure readings was smaller than
               predicted (0.49 mmHg/cm systolic and 0.47 mmHg/cm diastolic). No
               significant correlation was found between blood pressure
               difference in the different arm positions (desk and heart level)
               and age, sex, weight or baseline blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS:
               Different arm positions below heart level have significant
               effects on blood pressure readings. The leading guidelines about
               arm position during blood pressure measurement are not in

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: Blood pressure is a major cause of cardiovascular
               disease (CVD) and both may increase as outdoor temperatures
               fall. However, there are still limited data about seasonal
               variation in blood pressure and CVD mortality among patients
               with prior-CVD. METHODS: We analysed data on 23 000 individuals
               with prior-CVD who were recruited from 10 diverse regions into
               the China Kadoorie Biobank during 2004-8. After 7 years of
               follow-up, 1484 CVD deaths were recorded. Baseline survey data
               were used to assess seasonal variation in systolic blood
               pressure (SBP) and its association with outdoor temperature. Cox
               regression was used to examine the association of usual SBP with
               subsequent CVD mortality, and seasonal variation in CVD
               mortality was assessed by Poisson regression. All analyses were
               adjusted for age, sex, and region. RESULTS: Mean SBP was
               significantly higher in winter than in summer (145 vs. 136 mmHg,
               P < 0.001), especially among those without central heating.
               Above 5°C, each 10°C lower outdoor temperature was associated
               with 6.2 mmHg higher SBP. Systolic blood pressure predicted
               subsequent CVD mortality, with each 10 mmHg higher usual SBP
               associated with 21\% (95\% confidence interval: 16-27\%)
               increased risk. Cardiovascular disease mortality varied by
               season, with 41\% (21-63\%) higher risk in winter compared with
               summer. CONCLUSION: Among adult Chinese with prior-CVD, there is
               both increased blood pressure and CVD mortality in winter.
               Careful monitoring and more aggressive blood pressure lowering
               treatment in the cold months are needed to help reduce the

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVES: Both low temperature and high air pollution have
               been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events,
               which could be predicted by increased arterial blood pressure
               (BP) within short periods. However, whether exposures to
               temperature and air pollution simultaneously may have
               interactive effects on BP has been unknown. We investigated this
               potential interaction during 460 repeated visits in 39 healthy
               university students in the context of traffic-related air
               pollution. METHODS: Study participants in the Healthy Volunteer
               Natural Relocation study underwent repeated BP measurements for
               12 occasions under three exposure scenarios in Beijing, China,
               in 2010-2011. We used generalized linear mixed-effects models to
               estimate exposure effects. RESULTS: Decreasing temperature was
               associated with significant increases in BP. There were
               significant interactions between temperature and traffic-related
               air pollutants (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter
               $\leq$2.5 $\mu$m, organic carbon, elemental carbon and nitrogen
               dioxide) on BP (P < 0.05 for all interaction tests). The
               estimated increases in SBP and DBP were 4.9 mmHg [95\%
               confidence interval (CI) 2.9-6.8] and 3.7 mmHg (95\% CI 2.3-5.1)
               at high elemental carbon level ($\geq$median), and were -1.3
               mmHg (95\% CI -6.3 to 3.6) and 0.7 mmHg (95\% CI -2.8 to 4.2) at
               low elemental carbon level (<median) per 10°C decrease in daily
               minimum temperature. We also found stronger air pollution
               effects on BP at low temperature levels (<median) than at high
               temperature levels ($\geq$median). CONCLUSION: Low temperature
               and high air pollution may act synergistically to increase BP in
               healthy adults. Our findings may have potential implications for
               prevention of cardiovascular events associated with increased BP

               mechanisms remain incompletely understood. It was hypothesized
               that brachial flow and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) would vary
               by season and temperature. Season and temperature were related
               to ultrasonic brachial artery endothelium-dependent FMD\% (n =
               2,587), baseline flow velocity, and maximal reactive hyperemia

               10 years, 53\% women). Outdoor temperatures were obtained from
               National Climate Data Center records for Bedford, Massachusetts
               (about 14 miles from the testing site), and the examination room
               temperature was measured. In multivariate models, FMD\% was
               highest in summer and lowest in winter (3.01 +/- 0.09\% vs 2.56
               +/- 0.10\%, respectively, p = 0.02 for differences across all 4
               seasons). FMD\% was highest in the warmest and lowest in the
               coldest outdoor-temperature quartiles. In stepwise models
               adjusting for risk factors and selecting among season, outdoor
               temperature, and room temperature, FMD\% was associated with
               season (p = 0.02); temperature did not enter the model. In
               contrast, hyperemic flow velocity was significantly lower for
               cooler and higher for warmer room temperatures (p = 0.02
               overall); season did not enter the model. Season and outdoor and
               room temperature were each retained in a stepwise model of
               baseline flow velocity (p <0.0001, p = 0.02, and p <0.0001,
               respectively). In conclusion, a significant association was
               observed between season and FMD\%. Microvascular vasodilator
               function, as reflected by hyperemic flow velocity, was more
               strongly related to temperature than season. Endothelial

               random zero sphygmomanometer under standardised conditions. With
               the smallest bladder (13 x 23 cm) the highest systolic and

               pressure (MAP) during orthostatic challenge, a response that may
               contribute to alcohol-mediated syncope. Muscle sympathetic nerve
               activity (MSNA) increases during orthostatic stress to help

               MSNA and HR increased during all LBNP protocols, but there were
               no differences between trials or groups. However, alcohol

  abstract  = "OBJECTIVE: Moderate consumption of beer is associated with lower
               cardiovascular (CV) risk. The goal of this study was to
               determine the effect of beer consumption on CV risk. To explore
               the underlying mechanisms, we studied the acute effects of the
               constituents of beer (alcohol and antioxidants), on established
               predictors of CV risk: endothelial function, aortic stiffness,
               pressure wave reflections and aortic pressure. METHODS: In a
               randomized, single-blind, crossover study, 17 healthy,
               non-smoking, men (ages 28.5 $\pm$ 5.2 y with body mass index
               24.4 $\pm$ 2.5 kg/m(2)) consumed on three separate occasions, at
               least 1 wk apart: 1. 400 mL of beer and 400 mL water, 2. 800 mL
               of dealcoholized beer (same amount of polyphenols as in the 400
               mL of beer), and 3. 67 mL of vodka and 733 mL water (same amount
               of alcohol as in the 400 mL of beer). Each time aortic stiffness
               (pulse wave velocity), pressure wave reflections (A$I$x), aortic
               and brachial pressure (Sphygmocor device), and endothelial
               function (brachial flow mediated dilatation) were assessed at
               fast and 1 and 2 h postprandial. RESULTS: Aortic stiffness was
               significantly and similarly reduced by all three interventions.
               However, endothelial function was significantly improved only
               after beer consumption (average 1.33\%, 95\% confidence interval
               [CI] 0.15-2.53). Although wave reflections were significantly
               reduced by all three interventions (average of beer: 9.1\%,
               dealcoholized beer: 2.8\%, vodka 8.5\%, all CI within limits of
               significance), the reduction was higher after beer consumption
               compared with dealcoholized beer (P = 0.018). Pulse pressure
               amplification (i.e., brachial/aortic) was increased by all three
               test drinks. CONCLUSIONS: Beer acutely improves parameters of
               arterial function and structure, in healthy non-smokers. This
               benefit seems to be mediated by the additive or synergistic
               effects of alcohol and antioxidants and merits further
               investigation.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: The detrimental effects of chronic heavy alcohol use
               on the cardiovascular system are well established and broadly
               appreciated. Integrated cardiovascular response to an acute dose
               of alcohol has been less studied. This study examined the early
               effects of an acute dose of alcohol on the cardiovascular
               system, with particular emphasis on system variability and
               sensitivity. The goal was to begin to understand how acute
               alcohol disrupts dynamic cardiovascular regulatory processes
               prior to the development of cardiovascular disease. METHODS:
               Healthy participants (N = 72, age 21 to 29) were randomly
               assigned to an alcohol, placebo, or no-alcohol control beverage
               condition. Beat-to-beat heart rate (HR) and blood pressure (BP)
               were assessed during a low-demand cognitive task prior to and
               following beverage consumption. Between-group differences in
               neurocardiac response to an alcohol challenge (blood alcohol
               concentration ~ 0.06 mg/dl) were tested. RESULTS: The alcohol
               beverage group showed higher average HR, lower average stroke
               volume, lower HR variability and BP variability, and increased
               vascular tone baroreflex sensitivity after alcohol consumption.
               No changes were observed in the placebo group, but the control
               group showed slightly elevated average HR and BP after beverage
               consumption, possibly due to juice content. At the level of the
               individual, an active alcohol dose appeared to disrupt the
               typically tight coupling between cardiovascular processes.
               CONCLUSIONS: A dose of alcohol quickly invoked multiple
               cardiovascular responses, possibly as an adaptive reaction to
               the acute pharmacological challenge. Future studies should
               assess how exposure to alcohol acutely disrupts or dissociates
               typically integrated neurocardiac functions.",

              of ingesting a small amount of beer, corresponding to the amount

              B350), and were monitored for 90 min postingestion. There were no
              significant changes in arterial stiffness among trials that
              ingested AF200 or AF350. However, among trials ingesting B200 and
              B350, breath alcohol concentrations increased significantly,

              approximately 60 min: carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (B200:
              -0.6 $\pm$ 0.2 m/sec; B350: -0.6 $\pm$ 0.2 m/sec); brachial-ankle

              unit; B350: -0.3 $\pm$ 0.1 unit). Furthermore, AFB showed no
              effect on arterial stiffness, regardless of whether or not it
              contained sugar, and no significant difference in antioxidant
              capacity was found between AFB and B. This is the first study to
              demonstrate that acute ingestion of relatively small amounts of
              beer reduces arterial stiffness (for approximately 60 min). Our
              data also suggest that the reduction in arterial stiffness
              induced by ingestion of beer is largely attributable to the
              effects of alcohol.",

               reported previously differential cardiovascular stimulation of
               coffee at rest depending on habitual consumption. The present
               study was designed to evaluate the effects of coffee on
               cardiovascular response to mental stress. In 15 healthy
               volunteers (6 habitual, 9 nonhabitual coffee drinkers), we
               assessed the effect of mental stress on blood pressure (BP),
               heart rate (HR), and muscle sympathetic activity (MSA) before
               and after a triple espresso, intravenous caffeine, and placebo
               in the same subjects. Under baseline conditions, mental stress
               significantly increases MSA (+2.5+/-0.7 volts per minute;
               +14.1+/-10.3\%), systolic (+11.6+/-4.1 mm Hg) and diastolic BP
               (+6.4+/-2.0 mm Hg), and HR (+9.6+/-1.8 minutes(-1)). In
               nonhabitual coffee drinkers, a triple espresso but not caffeine
               induced an additional increase in systolic BP (+9+/-6.3 mm Hg;
               P=0.003) during mental stress, whereas in habitual drinkers, the
               stress-induced BP increase was blunted (+4+/-3.9 mm Hg; P=NS).
               As a result, nonhabitual coffee drinkers experienced
               significantly higher BP during mental stress than habitual
               drinkers (151+/-17.9/83+/-5.6 mm Hg versus 130+/-7.8/74+/-6.7 mm
               Hg; P<0.05). Caffeine induced similar effects in habitual and
               nonhabitual coffee drinkers at rest and during mental stress.
               The response to the cold pressor test was not influenced by
               coffee drinking in both groups. In conclusion, in nonhabitual
               coffee drinkers, coffee enhances the cardiovascular response to
               mental stress with an additional increase in systolic BP,
               whereas in habitual drinkers, the response is blunted. Caffeine
               alone does not exert any potentiating effect, confirming that
               ingredients other than caffeine are partially responsible for
               the stimulating effect of coffee on the cardiovascular system.",

               responses to caffeine appear to be associated with the size of

               insufficient evidence to determine whether the type or
               temperature of coffee consumed will have a different impact on
               the gut-brain axis. The purpose of this study was to investigate
               the effects of acute coffee consumption on the following: 1.
               self-reported GI symptoms and salivary gastrin, 2. stress
               indices [salivary cortisol and alpha-amylase (sAA)] and
               psychometric measures, and 3. blood pressure (BP), in healthy,
               daily coffee consuming individuals in non-stressful conditions.
               METHODS: This was a randomized, double blind, crossover clinical
               trial, in which 40 healthy individuals (20 men, 20 women), 20-55
               years of age, randomly consumed four 200 ml coffee beverages
               containing 160 mg caffeine (hot and cold instant coffee, cold
               espresso, hot filtered coffee), 1 week apart. Salivary samples
               and psychometric questionnaires were collected at baseline and
               post-coffee consumption at 15,30, and 60 min for salivary
               gastrin and sAA measurements and at 60,120, and 180 min for
               cortisol measurements. BP was measured at beginning and end of
               each intervention. ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02253628 RESULTS:
               Coffee consumption significantly increased sAA activity (P =
               0.041), with significant differences only between cold instant
               and filter coffee at 15 and 30 min post-consumption (P < 0.05).
               Coffee temporarily increased salivary gastrin, without
               differences between coffee types. Coffee did not affect salivary
               cortisol or self-reported anxiety levels. Coffee consumption
               significantly increased BP, within the healthy physiological
               levels, in a gender specific manner at the end of the
               experimental periods, without differences between coffee types.
               CONCLUSION: Acute coffee consumption in non-stressful conditions
               activated sAA and BP but not salivary cortisol, indicating
               activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Post-coffee sAA
               increase without a concomitant cortisol increase may also
               indicate that coffee may have some anti-stress properties.",

              divided into 4 groups, which consumed three portions of noni or
              chokeberry juices (30 mL or 200 mL, respectively) and energy
              drink (ED) or water (200 mL) at one-hour intervals. All
              participants had their blood pressure (BP), both systolic and
              diastolic BP (SBP and DBP), as well as heart rate (HR) and blood
              glucose (BG), measured. Consumption of noni juice caused a
              significant decrease in SBP and DBP of 5.0\% and 7.5\%,
              respectively, while, the consumption of chokeberry juice slightly
              decreased only DBP by 3.6\%. On the contrary, consumption of
              three portions of EDs caused a significant increase in DBP by
              14.7\%. The BG of participants consuming noni juice decreased by
              7.3\%, while the consumption of EDs increased BG by as much as
              15.8\%. Acute consumption of noni juice contributed to a
              significantly decreased SBP, DBP, and HR as well as a mild
              reduction of BG. Consumption of chokeberry juice caused only a
              slight reduction of DBP. Contrary to juices, EDs consumption
              resulted in an increase of blood pressure (especially DBP) and
              blood glucose. The results of the study showed that noni juice
              may be effective in lowering blood pressure and blood sugar

               stress on body temperature and blood pressure of elderly
               individuals living in poor housing conditions. METHODS: Repeated
               measurements of the indoor temperature, relative humidity, body
               temperature, and blood pressure were conducted for 20 elderly
               individuals living in low-cost dosshouses in Seoul during hot
               summer days in 2010. Changes in the body temperature, systolic
               blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)
               according to variations in the indoor and outdoor temperature
               and humidity were analyzed using a repeated-measures ANOVA
               controlling for age, sex, alcohol, and smoking. RESULTS: Average
               indoor and outdoor temperatures were 31.47℃ (standard deviation
               [SD], 0.97℃) and 28.15℃ (SD, 2.03℃), respectively. Body
               temperature increased by 0.21℃ (95\% confidence interval [CI],
               0.16 to 0.26℃) and 0.07℃ (95\% CI, 0.04 to 0.10℃) with an
               increase in the indoor and outdoor temperature of 1℃. DBP
               decreased by 2.05 mmHg (95\% CI, 0.05 to 4.05 mmHg), showing a
               statistical significance, as the indoor temperature increased by
               1℃, while it increased by 0.20 mmHg (95\% CI, -0.83 to 1.22
               mmHg) as outdoor temperature increased by 1℃. SBP decreased by
               1.75 mmHg (95\% CI, -1.11 to 4.61 mmHg) and 0.35 mmHg (95\% CI,
               -1.04 to 1.73 mmHg), as the indoor and outdoor temperature
               increased by 1℃, respectively. The effects of relative humidity
               on SBP and DBP were not statistically significant for both
               indoor and outdoor. CONCLUSIONS: The poor and elderly are
               directly exposed to heat waves, while their vital signs respond
               sensitively to increase in temperature. Careful adaptation

               difference in blood pressure of the general Korean population to
               identify associated factors. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A total of
               806 participants aged 30 to 64 years without history of major
               cardiovascular disease were analyzed in this cross-sectional
               study. They participated in the Cardiovascular and Metabolic
               Disease Etiology Research Center cohort study that began in
               2013. Brachial blood pressure was measured simultaneously for
               both arms using an automated oscillometric device equipped with
               two cuffs in seated position. After five minutes of rest,
               systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)
               were measured three times. The average of the three measurements
               was used for analysis. Multivariate logistic regression models
               were used to identify factors associated with inter-arm
               differences in blood pressure. RESULTS: The mean inter-arm
               difference was 3.3 mmHg for SBP and 2.0 mmHg for DBP. Large
               inter-arm differences ($\geq$10 mmHg) in SBP and in DBP were
               found in 3.7\% and 0.9\% of subjects, respectively. A large
               inter-arm difference in SBP was associated with mean SBP
               (p=0.002) and C-reactive protein (p=0.014) while a large
               inter-arm different in DBP was only associated with body mass
               index (p=0.015). Sex, age, and anti-hypertensive medication use
               were not associated with differences in inter-arm blood
               pressure. CONCLUSION: Large inter-arm difference in blood
               pressure is only present in a small portion of healthy Korean
               adults. Our findings suggest that high SBP, chronic
               inflammation, and obesity may be associated with larger
               difference in inter-arm blood pressure.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: According to the current guidelines for blood
               pressure monitoring, clinicians are recommended to measure blood
               pressure by completely exposing the upper arm. However, it is a
               common practice that blood pressure is measured with the cuff
               placed over the sleeve or with the sleeve rolled up. We
               therefore conducted this study to examine whether there are any
               differences in blood pressure measurements among the three
               different settings: the sleeve group, the rolled sleeve group,
               and the bare arm group. METHODS: We conducted the current study
               in 141 male and female adult patients who visited our clinical
               department. In these patients, we took repeatedly blood pressure
               measurements using the same automatic oscillometric device on
               three different settings. Then, we analyzed the results with the
               use of randomized block design analysis of variance. RESULTS:
               The mean values of systolic blood pressure (SBP) between the
               first reading and those of the second reading were 128.5 $\pm$
               10.6 mm Hg in the sleeve group, 128.3 $\pm$ 10.8 mm Hg in the
               rolled sleeve group, and 128.3 $\pm$ 10.7 mm Hg in the bare arm
               group. These results indicate that there were no significant
               differences among the three groups (P = 0.32). In addition, the
               mean values of diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between the first
               reading and those of the second reading were 80.7 $\pm$ 6.1 mm
               Hg in the sleeve group, 80.7 $\pm$ 6.1 mm Hg in the rolled
               sleeve group, and 80.6 $\pm$ 5.9 mm Hg in the bare arm group.
               These results indicate that there were no significant
               differences among the three groups (P = 0.77). In addition,
               based on the age, sex, past or current history of hypertension
               or diabetes mellitus, the thickness of sleeve, weight, a
               drinking history, and a smoking history, there were no
               significant differences in SBP and DBP among the three groups.
               CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences in blood
               pressure measurements between the three different settings (the
               sleeve group, the rolled sleeve group, and the bare arm group).",

  abstract = "Measuring blood pressure during pregnancy is an essential
              component of antenatal care, and is critical for detecting
              adverse conditions such as pre-eclampsia. The standard approach
              for measuring blood pressure is via manual auscultation by a
              trained expert or via an oscillometric self-inflating cuff. While
              both methods can provide reasonably accurate blood pressure
              measurements when used correctly, non-expert use can lead to
              significant error. Moreover, such techniques are uncomfortable
              and can cause bruising, pain and consequential resistance to use
              / low compliance. In this work, we propose a low-cost
              onedimensional Doppler-based method for the detection of
              hypertension in pregnancy.Using a sample of 653 pregnant women of
              Mayan descent in highland Guatemala, we recorded up to 10 minutes
              of 1D Doppler data of the fetus, and blood pressure from both
              arms using an Omron M7 oscillometric cuff. A hierarchical LSTM
              network with attention mechanism was trained to classify
              hypertension in pregnancy, producing an area under the
              receiveroperator curve of 0.94. A projection of the data into
              lower dimensions indicates hypertensive cases are located at the
              periphery of the distribution of the output of the
              distribution.This work presents the first demonstration that
              blood pressure can be measured using Doppler (without occlusion)
              and may lead to a novel class of blood pressure monitors which
              allow rapid blood pressure estimation from multiple body
              locations. Moreover, the association of the predictor with the
              fetal blood flow indicates that hypertension in the mother has a
              significant effect on the fetal blood flow.",

              accessibility and usability of BP data for monitoring and
              managing BP during pregnancy and postpartum, particularly in
              low-resource settings. To this end, we developed an automated
              image transcription technique to effectively transcribe readings
              from BP devices. The photos of the BP devices were captured as
              part of perinatal mobile health (mHealth) monitoring systems,
              conducted in four studies across two countries. The Guatemala Set
              1 and Guatemala Set 2 datasets include the data captured by a
              cohort of 49 lay midwives from 1697 and 584 pregnant women
              carrying singletons in the second and third trimesters in rural
              Guatemala during routine screening. Additionally, we designed an
              mHealth system in Georgia for postpartum women to monitor and
              report their BP at home with 23 and 49 African American
              participants contributing to the Georgia I3 and Georgia IMPROVE
              projects, respectively. We developed a deep learning-based model
              which operates in two steps: LCD localization using the You Only
              Look Once (YOLO) object detection model and digit recognition
              using a convolutional neural network-based model capable of
              recognizing multiple digits. We applied color correction and
              thresholding techniques to minimize the impact of reflection and
              artifacts. Three experiments were conducted based on the devices
              used for training the digit recognition model. Overall, our
              results demonstrate that the device-specific model with transfer
              learning and the device independent model outperformed the
              device-specific model without transfer learning. The mean
              absolute error (MAE) of image transcription on held-out test
              datasets using the device-independent digit recognition were 1.1
              and 1.1 mmHg for systolic and diastolic BP in the Georgia IMPROVE
              and 1 and 0.6 mmHg in Guatemala Set 2 datasets. The MAE, far
              below the FDA requirement of 5 mmHg, makes the proposed model
              suitable for general use when used with appropriate error

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Several epidemiological studies have shown that
               blood pressure changes with temperature based on the daily
               temperature and linear relationship assumption. However, little
               is known about the true curve shape of the relationship between
               temperature and blood pressure. OBJECTIVES: The objective of
               this study was to investigate the non-linear relationship
               between hourly temperature and blood pressure. METHODS: This is
               a prospective panel study comprising 100 participants in Suzhou,
               China. The blood pressure of each participant was measured >50
               times between October 2013 and January 2016. Hourly temperature
               data were derived from the nearest monitoring station owned by
               the China Meteorological Administration. A Distributed Lag
               Nonlinear Model (DLNM) was used to investigate the relationship
               between hourly temperature and blood pressure. RESULTS: We found
               that the relationship between hourly temperature and blood
               pressure was parabolic. Short-term exposure to hourly
               temperatures had significant cold and heat effects on systolic
               blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse
               pressure (PP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP). The hourly
               temperature had a significant lag effect on blood pressure, with
               a lag time of 0-5 h. Alcohol users were more sensitive to the
               cold effects of hourly temperature, and the diabetic population
               was more sensitive to the heat effects of hourly temperature on
               PP. CONCLUSION: Temperature imparts short-term effects on blood
               pressure. Therefore, timely protective measures during cold

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Home blood pressure measurement (HBPM) is
               recommended for the diagnosis and follow-up of hypertensive
               patients. While measurement protocols emphasize a rest period
               before taking the measurement, this directive has not been
               supported by any specific study to date. This analysis aimed to
               determine whether the respect or nonrespect of rest before HBPM
               could introduce a difference between daytime ambulatory blood
               pressure measurement (ABPM) and HBPM; whether this rest is
               observed ``in real life'' among educated hypertensive patients.
               METHODS: In this open, prospective study we compared HBPM, with
               and without rest, and ABPM among 52 office/clinically controlled
               hypertensive patients. HBPM was performed during 3 days (French
               HAS instructions); 24-hour ABPM was performed within 3 days of
               HBPM. All patients who regularly performed HBPM before the study
               were asked how they practiced HBPM in real life. RESULTS: There
               was a differential impact of rest on differences observed in
               daytime ABPM and HBPM. Systolic HBPM decreased with rest, while
               diastolic HBPM did not significantly increase. HBPM systolic BP
               (SBP) without rest was not significantly different from daytime
               ABPM SBP (P = 0.27). HBPM SBP without rest was lower than
               daytime and 24-hour systolic ABPM. Diastolic HBPM after rest was
               not significantly different from daytime diastolic ABPM (P =
               0.09). None of the 38 patients who regularly performed HBPM were
               compliant with a period of rest before beginning the
               measurements. CONCLUSIONS: Rest before HBPM induces a bias that
               underestimates SBP vs. daytime ABPM and perhaps complicates
               patient adherence to HBPM protocols.",

               is related to false beliefs about biological differences between
               blacks and whites (e.g., ``black people's skin is thicker than
               white people's skin''). Study 1 documented these beliefs among
               white laypersons and revealed that participants who more
               strongly endorsed false beliefs about biological differences
               reported lower pain ratings for a black (vs. white) target.
               Study 2 extended these findings to the medical context and found
               that half of a sample of white medical students and residents
               endorsed these beliefs. Moreover, participants who endorsed
               these beliefs rated the black (vs. white) patient's pain as

               Participants who did not endorse these beliefs rated the black

               (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
               Meta-Analyses) methodology to perform a review of studies from
               1990 to 2018 comparing racial and ethnic differences in the
               administration of analgesia for acute pain. Studies were
               included if they measured analgesia use in white patients
               compared to a racial minority in the ED and studies were
               excluded if they focused primarily on chronic pain, case reports
               and survey studies. Following data abstraction, a meta-analysis
               was performed using fixed and random-effect models to determine
               primary outcome of analgesia administration stratified by racial
               and ethnic classification. RESULTS: 763 articles were screened
               for eligibility and fourteen studies met inclusion criteria for
               qualitative synthesis. The total study population included 7070
               non-Hispanic White patients, 1538 Hispanic, 3125 Black, and
               50.3\% female. Black patients were less likely than white to
               receive analgesia for acute pain: OR 0.60 [95\%-CI, 0.43-0.83,

               receive analgesia: OR 0.75 [95\%-CI, 0.52-1.09]. CONCLUSION:
               This study demonstrates the presence of racial disparities in

               significant racial bias: At a given risk score, Black patients

               (binned by decade), and race (Asian, Black, White, and Other)

               an additional constraint which simultaneously minimized

               is important for the prevention and treatment of hypertension.
               The oscillometric-based automatic office blood pressure
               measurement (AOBPM) is widely used in hospitals and clinics, but
               measurement errors are common in BP measurements. There is a
               lack of systematic review of the sources of measurement
               errors.Approach: A systematic review of all existing research on
               sources of AOBPM errors. A search strategy was designed in six
               online databases, and all the literature published before
               October 2021 was selected. Those studies that used the AOBPM
               device to measure BP from the upper arm of subjects were
               included.Main results: A total of 1365 studies were screened,
               and 224 studies were included in this final review. They
               investigated 22 common error sources with clinical AOBPM.
               Regarding the causes of BP errors, this review divided them into
               the following categories: the activities before measurement,
               patient's factors, measurement environment, measurement
               procedure, and device settings. 13 sources caused increased
               systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP), 2 sources caused the
               decrease in SBP and DBP, only 1 source had no significant effect
               on BPs, and the other errors had a non-uniform effect (either
               increase or decrease in BPs). The error ranges for SBP and DBP
               were -14 to 33 mmHg and -6 to 19 mmHg,
               respectively.Significance: The measurement accuracy of AOBPM is
               susceptible to the influence of measurement factors.
               Interpreting BP readings need to be treated with caution in
               clinical measurements. This review made comprehensive evidence
               for the need for standardized BP measurements and provided
               guidance for clinical practitioners when measuring BP with AOBPM

               interventions at four medical clinics combined with an online

               and useful intervention method providing that the
               recommendations are followed. A total of six challenges were
               identified: (1) existing devices do not guarantee that the
               recommendations are followed, (2) healthcare providers cannot
               verify whether self-monitoring patients follow the
               recommendations, (3) patients are not aware of all
               recommendations and the need to follow them, (4) risk of patient
               induced reporting bias, (5) risk of healthcare provider induced
               data-transfer bias, and (6) risk of data being registered as
               belonging to the wrong patient. We conclude that existing BPSM

               bias resulting in an indeterminable quality of the measurement

               of measuring blood pressure was investigated using a
               computer-based model. To determine the relationship between the
               cuff deflation rate and the measurement error, two cuff
               deflation protocols were used, one based on heart rate (mm Hg
               per heartbeat), the other on a constant rate (mm Hg per second).
               The different deflation protocols and rates were tested using a
               constant blood pressure of 120/80 mm Hg and heart rates ranging
               from 40 to 120 beats/min. It was confirmed that a cuff deflation
               rate that is time based will introduce larger errors at low
               heart rates. Using heart rate as a basis for cuff deflation rate
               yields a constant error that is independent of heart rate. The
               currently used standard of 3 mm Hg/s could result in a maximum
               error of 2.5 mm Hg in both systolic and diastolic pressures at a
               heart rate of 72 beats/min. The maximum systolic and diastolic
               errors increase to more than 4 mm Hg at 40 beats/min. A
               deflation rate of 2 mm Hg/beat, however, yields a maximum error
               of 2 mm Hg for both systolic and diastolic pressures,
               independent of heart rate. A cuff deflation rate based on heart
               rate is recommended to help minimize changes in measurement
               error when measuring blood pressure if a wide range of heart
               rates will be encountered.",

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: Blood pressure measurement in clinical care
               settings seldom follows the protocol recommended by national
               guidelines, potentially leading to overestimates or
               underestimates of blood pressure control. We evaluated blood
               pressure measurement methods as a source of bias in determining
               blood pressure control among community-dwelling adults with
               diabetes. METHODS: In a community-based trial of patients with
               diabetes, we measured both ``clinical blood pressure'' (clinical
               BP) (taken by a community nurse or medical assistant instructed
               to ``take the participant's blood pressure like you do in your
               own clinic'') and ``research blood pressure'' (research BP)
               (research staff followed a guideline-concordant protocol). Each
               participant had both types of blood pressure assessment on the
               same day over the course of 2 hours. RESULTS: The 227
               participants had a mean age of 59 years; 86\% were black and
               74\% were women. The mean clinical BP was 5 mm Hg higher than
               the mean research BP for systolic blood pressure (P < .001) and
               2 mm Hg higher for diastolic blood pressure (P < .001). The
               proportion of participants whose clinical BP was 130/80 mm Hg or
               higher was 8 percentage points higher than the proportion whose
               research BP was 130/80 mm Hg or higher (P < .001), and the
               proportion whose clinical BP was 140/90 mm Hg or higher was 10
               percentage points higher than the proportion whose research BP
               was 140/90 mm Hg or higher (P < .001). Among those aged 65 years
               or older, the proportion whose clinical BP was 130/80 mm Hg or
               higher was 10 percentage points higher than proportion whose
               research BP was 130/80 mm Hg or higher, and the proportion whose
               clinical BP was 140/90 mm Hg or higher was 14 percentage points
               higher than the proportion whose research BP was 140/90 mm Hg or
               higher. Whites and smokers had the greatest risk for having a
               clinical BP 5 mm Hg or more higher than their research BP.
               CONCLUSION: Measurement biases in clinical settings may be a

               responses. However, the precise effect remains elusive. We aimed
               to determine in healthy adults the effect of water on cardiac
               workload and to investigate potential gender differences. We
               pooled data from two controlled studies where blood pressure
               (BP) and heart rate (HR) were continuously recorded before and
               after the ingestion of 355 mL of tap water. Additionally, we
               calculated double product by multiplying systolic BP with HR and
               evaluated spectral parameters referring to vagal tone. All
               parameters were investigated for potential differences based on
               gender. In response to water, HR, systolic BP, and double
               product decreased significantly during the first 30 min.
               However, these effects were attenuated for HR and double product
               and even abolished for systolic BP over the subsequent 30 min.
               Over the entire post-drink period (60 min), decreases in HR and

  abstract  = "Abstract BACKGROUND This work aimed to explore whether different
               forms of a simple isometric exercise test could be used to
               predict the blood pressure (BP)-lowering efficacy of different
               types of isometric resistance training (IRT) in healthy young
               adults. In light of the emphasis on primary prevention of
               hypertension, identifying those with normal BP who will respond
               to IRT is important. Also, heightened BP reactivity increases
               hypertension risk, and as IRT reduces BP reactivity in patients
               with hypertension, it warrants further investigation in a
               healthy population. METHODS Forty-six young men and women (24
               $\pm$ 5 years; 116 $\pm$ 10/ 68 $\pm$ 8 mm Hg) were recruited
               from 2 study sites: Windsor, Canada (n = 26; 13 women), and
               Northampton, United Kingdom (n = 20; 10 women). Resting BP and
               BP reactivity to an isometric exercise test were assessed prior
               to and following 10 weeks of thrice weekly IRT. Canadian
               participants trained on a handgrip dynamometer (isometric
               handgrip, IHG), while participants in the UK trained on an
               isometric leg extension dynamometer (ILE). RESULTS Men and women
               enrolled in both interventions demonstrated significant
               reductions in systolic BP (P < 0.001) and pulse pressure (P <
               0.05). Additionally, test-induced systolic BP changes to IHG and
               ILE tests were associated with IHG and ILE training-induced
               reductions in systolic BP after 10 weeks of training,
               respectively (r = 0.58 and r = 0.77; for IHG and ILE; P < 0.05).
               CONCLUSIONS The acute BP response to an isometric exercise test
               appears to be a viable tool to identify individuals who may

              pressure (BP) has been inconclusive. We analyzed data from a
              prospective cohort study in northwestern China to investigate the
              effect of outdoor temperature on BP and effect modification by
              season. METHODS: A total of 32,710 individuals who participated
              in both the baseline survey and the first follow-up in 2011-2015
              were included in the study. A linear mixed-effect model and
              generalized additive mixed model (GAMM) were applied to estimate
              the association between outdoor temperature and BP after
              adjusting for confounding variables. RESULTS: The mean
              differences in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood
              pressure (DBP) between summer and winter were 3.5 mmHg and 2.75
              mmHg, respectively. After adjusting for individual
              characteristics, meteorological factors and air pollutants, a
              significant increase in SBP and DBP was observed for lag 06 day
              and lag 04 day, a 0.28 mmHg (95\% CI: 0.27-0.30) per 1 °C
              decrease in average temperature for SBP and a 0.16 mmHg (95\% CI:
              0.15-0.17) per 1 °C decrease in average temperature for DBP,
              respectively. The effects of the average temperature on both SBP
              and DBP were stronger in summer than in other seasons. The
              effects of the average temperature on BP were also greater if

              negative association between outdoor temperature and BP in a
              high-altitude environment of northwest China. Moreover, BP showed
              a significant seasonal variation. The association between BP and

               across 31 provinces in China. METHODS: A representative
               population sample (n = 451,770) were obtained from the China
               Hypertension Survey study (CHS) from October 2012 to December
               2015. Survey seasons were divided into warm and cold seasons.
               Survey sites were divided into three climate zones as
               subtropical, temperate monsoon and temperate continental zones.
               RESULTS: After adjustment for confounders, an overall 10 °C
               decrease in ambient temperature was statistically associated
               0.74 mmHg (95\% CI: 0.69, 0.79) and 0.60 mmHg (95\% CI: -0.63,

               and liner curves in other zones. A greater SBP change due to a
               lower temperature was observed in subtropical zones, so did DBP
               in temperate continental zones, especially for cold season.
               Female, rural and elderly populations were more susceptible to
               cold weather than their counterparts. DISCUSSION: There is a

              stream. Mature red blood cells are generated from multipotent
              hematopoietic stem cells, through a complex maturation process
              involving several morphological changes to produce a highly
              functional specialized cells. In mammals, terminal steps involved
              expulsion of the nucleus from erythroblasts that leads to the
              formation of reticulocytes. In order to produce mature biconcave
              red blood cells, organelles and ribosomes are selectively
              eliminated from reticulocytes as well as the plasma membrane
              undergoes remodeling. The mechanisms involved in these last
              maturation steps are still under investigation. Enucleation
              involves dramatic chromatin condensation and establishment of the
              nuclear polarity, which is driven by a rearrangement of actin
              cytoskeleton and the clathrin-dependent generation of vacuoles at
              the nuclear-cytoplasmic junction. This process is favored by
              interaction between the erythroblasts and macrophages at the
              erythroblastic island. Mitochondria are eliminated by mitophagy.
              This is a macroautophagy pathway consisting in the engulfment of
              mitochondria into a double-membrane structure called
              autophagosome before degradation. Several mice knock-out models
              were developed to identify mitophagy-involved proteins during
              erythropoiesis, but whole mechanisms are not completely
              determined. Less is known concerning the clearance of other
              organelles, such as smooth and rough ER, Golgi apparatus and
              ribosomes. Understanding the modulators of organelles clearance
              in erythropoiesis may elucidate the pathogenesis of different
              dyserythropoietic diseases such as myelodysplastic syndrome,
              leukemia and anemia.",

  title     = "Gravity, the hydrostatic indifference concept and the
               cardiovascular system",
  author    = "Hinghofer-Szalkay, Helmut",
  abstract  = "Gravity, like any acceleration, causes a hydrostatic pressure
               gradient in fluid-filled bodily compartments. At a force of 1G,
               this pressure gradient amounts to 10 kPa/m. Postural changes
               alter the distribution of hydrostatic pressure patterns
               according to the body's alignment to the acceleration field. At
               a certain location--referred to as hydrostatically
               indifferent--within any given fluid compartment, pressure
               remains constant during a given change of position relative to
               the acceleration force acting upon the body. At this specific
               location, there is probably little change in vessel volume, wall
               tension, and the balance of Starling forces after a positional
               manoeuvre. In terms of cardiac function, this is important
               because arterial and venous hydrostatic indifference locations
               determine postural cardiac preload and afterload changes.
               Baroreceptors pick up pressure signals that depend on their
               respective distance to hydrostatic indifference locations with
               any change of body position. Vascular shape, filling volume, and
               compliance, as well as temperature, nervous and endocrine
               factors, drugs, and time all influence hydrostatic indifference
               locations. This paper reviews the physiology of pressure
               gradients in the cardiovascular system that are operational in a
               gravitational/acceleration field, offers a broadened hydrostatic
               indifference concept, and discusses implications that are
               relevant in physiological and clinical terms.",
