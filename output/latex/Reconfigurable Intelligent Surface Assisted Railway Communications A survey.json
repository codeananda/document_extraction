  "abstract": "The number of train passengers and the demand for high data rates to handle new technologies such as video streaming and IoT technologies are continuously increasing. Therefore the exploration of millimeter waves (mmWave) band is a key technology to meet this demand. However, the high penetration loss makes mmWave very sensitive to blocking, limiting its coverage area. One promising, efficient, and low-cost solution is the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). This paper reviews the state of the art of RIS for railway communications in the mmWave context. First, we present the different types of RIS and review some optimization algorithms used in the literature to find the RIS phase shift. Then, we review recent works on RIS in the railway domain and provide future directions.",

      "content": "\\label{Intro} The need to double the capacity of the existing rail networks and, at the same time to increase the overall quality of service is leading to a drastic increase in the need for high data rates and robust and low latency data exchange between the different actors in the rail system. This multiplication of transmission needs ultimately leads to problems of spectrum scarcity. In this context, using mmWave bands opens up new opportunities. However, mmWaves suffer from very high attenuation and high sensitivity to various masking effects. In this context, Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces offers promising application use cases. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface, known in the literature by several nomenclatures as Software-Controlled Metasurface \\cite{liaskos2018new}, Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) \\cite{9326394}, Large Intelligent Surface (LIS) \\cite{8644519}, and Reconfigurable Smart Surface (RSS) \\cite{alfattani2021link}, is an electromagnetic-based reconfigurable structure that turns the random nature of the propagation channel into a controllable and programmable radio environment. RIS is a thin planar meta-surface made of several low-cost reflective elements \\cite{8910627}. Each RIS element adjusts the phase and amplitude of the incident wave to reflect it into a beam toward the target direction. This improves the signal quality and extends the coverage area especially when the direct link is blocked. The paper's main objective is to provide the reader with the basic elements to understand RIS and its interest in a railway communication environment. To do so, we review the literature in the domain and propose some future research directions. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section~\\ref{sec:RIS} provides a literature overview related to RIS, such as the different RIS structures and types, and their opportunity in the context of mmWave communications. We stress the need for realistic channel models in order to properly evaluate the performance of RIS-assisted systems. Section~\\ref{sec:RIS_Railway} focuses on very recent works investigating RIS-assisted systems for railway communications. Finally, in Section~\\ref{sec:future}, some future directions are drawn, and Section~\\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper.",

As the RIS should not encompass too many RF and signal processing resources to maintain a low level of energy consumption and complexity, the BS computes the needed tunable parameters and transfers commands to each RIS element thanks to a smart controller \\cite{9241881} as seen in Fig.\\ref{fig:ris}. To adjust phase shifts and amplitude of the incident wave, RIS consists of adjustable components, such as diodes and liquid crystals. The diodes adjust the signal by changing the bias voltage, while the liquid crystals adjust the electromagnetic signal by changing material parameters such as conductivity and permeability \\cite{9828501}. Indeed, the PIN diode-based RIS consists of three layers: 1) The outer layer with printed metal patches on a dielectric substrate. This layer directly processes the incident signals. 2) The intermediate layer composed of a copper panel to avoid signal energy loss. 3) The inner layer is a control board activated by a programmable digital electronic circuit (FPGA), allowing the real-time adjustment of the RIS elements' reflection coefficients \\cite{9828501}. Two reflexion paradigms govern propagation in the context of RIS-assisted communication systems, namely, the specular reflection paradigm and the scattering reflection paradigm, \\cite{alfattani2021link}. The differences are mainly related to the relation between the size of RIS $A_t$ and the distance D between BS-RIS or RIS-UE, as follows: \\begin{itemize} \\item The specular reflection paradigm: the transmission occurs in the near-field, i.e., $D<d_{lim} = \\frac{2A_{t}}{\\lambda}$\\footnote{$d_{lim}$ denotes the Rayleigh distance and is defined by $d_{lim}=\\frac{2A_{t}}{\\lambda} $ with $A_{t}$ the RIS area and $\\lambda$ the wavelength \\cite{alfattani2021link}.}. The path loss, in this case, depends on the summation of the distances between BS-RIS and RIS-UE. \\item The scattering reflection paradigm: the transmission occurs in the far-field, i.e., $D>d_{lim}$. In this case, the path loss depends on the product of the BS-RIS and RIS-UE separation distances. \\end{itemize} In the case of a passive RIS ($\\beta_n \\leq 1$), the RIS elements reflect the signal without amplification. Thus, in the context of scattering reflection communications (far-field), and by assuming the optimal phase shifts, the received power at the UE for the indirect link via passive RIS is expressed as \\cite{alfattani2021link}%\\textcolor{red}{[add reference]} \\begin{equation}\\label{eq:pN} P_{r}^{\\text{UE}}=P_tG_tG_r\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{4\\pi}\\right) ^4\\frac{(d_0)^{2\\mu-4}}{{(d_1d_2)^\\mu}}N^2 \\end{equation} where $P_t$ is the transmitted power at the BS, $G_t$ and $G_r$ are the transmit and receive antenna gains at the BS and the UE, respectively, $d_0$ the reference distance in the free space, $d_1$ and $d_2$ are BS-RIS distance and RIS-UE distance, $\\mu$ is the path loss exponent depending on the environment type (e.g., $\\mu \\ge 3$ for urban environments), and $N$ is the number of RIS elements. Thus, the passive RIS gives a gain proportional to $N^2$. However, the passive RIS has limitations due to the double-path loss effect. Indeed, the signal traverses two cascaded channels, the Tx-RIS link and the RIS-Rx link \\cite{9998527}. Thus, the received power via the indirect link could be greater than the power of the direct link, if $N$ is large, or/and if the direct link is weak or blocked. To illustrate this concept, we plot in Fig. \\ref{direct_indirect_Pr } the power received at the UE via an attenuated direct link, a direct link without attenuation, and the indirect link via the RIS, versus the number of RIS elements. The mmWave channel links are generated using an extended version of the New York University simulator NYUSIM \\cite{habib2023extended}. Note that to verify the RIS scattering reflection paradigm, the distances $d_1$, and $d_2$ must be in the far-field region. As RIS size increases, the distance where the RIS is in the near-field also increases. Thus, for the distances $d_1$, and $d_2$ to be in the far-field and equation (\\ref{eq:pN}) to be valid, $N$ must not exceed a certain $N_{\\max}$, computed from $d_{lim}$, the Rayleigh distance, and represented by a square in Fig. \\ref{direct_indirect_Pr } \\cite{habib2023extended}. The behavior of the RIS in the near-field is an interesting research topic. \\begin{figure} \\centering \\includegraphics[width=1.25\\columnwidth, trim=90 268 15 275, clip]{images/fig2uv.pdf} \\caption{Received power versus the number of RIS elements for the direct link (distance from BS to UE equal to $158.7$~m) with an obstacle of 50~dB attenuation and without obstacles and the indirect link via RIS ($d_1= 90$~m; $d_2 = 30$~m). } \\label{direct_indirect_Pr } \\vspace{-0.35cm} \\end{figure}",

The simulation results in a direct link scenario without attenuation for 256 RIS elements reveal a negligible sum-rate gain of $3~\\%$ using the passive RIS, while their proposed active RIS offers a significant sum-rate gain of $67~\\%$ compared to the case without RIS. Nevertheless, a RIS with a large number of active elements consumes more energy. Thus, the authors in \\cite{9833956} propose a novel type of RIS composed of active and passive reflective elements, called hybrid RIS, to deal with the limited power budget of the RIS. RIS based on continuous phase shifts is considered an ideal system that is difficult to implement in practice. Therefore, RIS based on finite discrete phase shifts is the alternative solution to cope with this hardware constraint. To this end, the authors in \\cite{9223720} compare the performance of RIS systems with continuous and discrete phase shifts and they find that 3 levels of quantization are sufficient to obtain full diversity.",

      "content": "The efficient functioning of the RIS is strongly affected by the adapted phase shifts $\\theta_n$. For instance, in Single Input Single Output (SISO) systems, the optimal phase shift of a RIS is easily determined analytically as follows \\cite{alfattani2021link} \\begin{equation}\\label{eq:angle_opt} \\theta_n=\\theta_{tn}+\\theta_{nr}. \\end{equation} where $\\theta_{tn}$ and $\\theta_{nr}$ are the phase of the LoS path in the BS-RIS and RIS-UE channels, respectively. However, it is hard to find the optimal phase shifts analytically in the case of Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) systems. To this end, an optimization algorithm is needed. \\cite{8982186} studied multi-user Multi Input Single Output (MISO) downlink communications assisted by RIS, where the objective is to maximize the weighted sum rate to find the optimized passive beamforming $\\theta_n$ and the optimized precoding at the BS. To solve this non-convex problem, they used the Lagrangian Dual Transform which transforms the sum-of-logarithms-of-ratio to an alternative form. \\\\ The authors in \\cite{9606297} discussed an indoor MISO multi-user system with a channel model based on the Rician K-factor. The RIS phase shift were configured as follows \\begin{equation} \\theta_n^*=\\arg(\\textbf{H}_d^H) - \\arg(\\textbf{H}_l^H)-\\arg(\\textbf{H}), \\end{equation} where $\\textbf{H}_d$ is the direct channel between the Tx and the Rx, $\\textbf{H}$ is the channel between Tx and RIS, and $\\textbf{H}_l$ is the channel between the RIS and the $l$th user. In \\cite{9160972}, the authors adopted a low-complex algorithm called the cosine similarity algorithm. The latter aims to find the sub-optimal phase shifts of the RIS that maximize the channel gain. Moreover, to minimize the transmitted power given the bit error rate for a RIS-assisted single-user multipath uplink system, the authors of \\cite{9495932} propose an iterative algorithm to jointly optimize precoding and passive beamforming.

However, it is very vulnerable to oxygen absorption and rain attenuation, and also suffers from penetration loss that makes mmWave signals easily blocked. Therefore, the coverage of mmWave communications is limited\\cite{9568459}. On the other hand, when the direct link is blocked or largely attenuated, a RIS is a competitive solution to extend coverage area and connectivity \\cite{9201413}. The location of the RIS should be optimized to obtain two efficient connections: the BS-RIS link and the RIS-UE link. The authors in \\cite{9824117} discuss the size limitation of the RIS in low frequencies below 6~GHz, which makes their deployment in this band inefficient. A study of the specific propagation characteristics of the terahertz band is needed to use RIS in these frequencies, and the most important implementation of RIS today is in the mmWave band. In the literature, the most used channels in RIS-assisted systems are the theoretical channels such as Rice for Line-of-Sight (LOS) environments, and Rayleigh for non-LOS (NLOS) \\cite{8982186}, \\cite{9738798}.

Railway tunnel size and shape are very specific, depending on the category of the train. Radio propagation inside tunnels is often modeled using Ray tracing tools \\cite{Qiu2021}, \\cite{He2018}.

Due to high speed, the train can rapidly go through diverse scenarios. In addition, Doppler effects and possible interference due to the proximity of high voltage (catenary) in the vicinity of the antennas render the railway environments very specific compared to the indoor, urban, or suburban environments generally considered today for the use of mmWave communication systems.
