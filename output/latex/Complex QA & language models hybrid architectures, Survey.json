  "title": "Complex QA \\& language models hybrid architectures, Survey",
  "abstract": "This paper reviews the state-of-the-art of language models architectures and strategies for \"complex\" question-answering (QA, CQA, CPS) with a focus on hybridization. Large Language Models (LLM) are good at leveraging public data on standard problems but once you want to tackle more specific complex questions or problems (e.g. How does the concept of personal freedom vary between different cultures ? What is the best mix of power generation methods to reduce climate change ?) you may need specific architecture, knowledge, skills, methods, sensitive data protection, explainability, human approval and versatile feedback... Recent projects like ChatGPT and GALACTICA have allowed non-specialists to grasp the great potential as well as the equally strong limitations of LLM in complex QA. In this paper, we start by reviewing required skills and evaluation techniques. We integrate findings from the robust community edited research papers BIG, BLOOM and HELM which open source, benchmark and analyze limits and challenges of LLM in terms of tasks complexity and strict evaluation on accuracy (e.g. fairness, robustness, toxicity, ...) as a baseline. We discuss some challenges associated with complex QA, including domain adaptation, decomposition and efficient multi-step QA, long form and non-factoid QA, safety and multi-sensitivity data protection, multimodal search, hallucinations, explainability and truthfulness, temporal reasoning. We analyze current solutions and promising research trends, using elements such as: hybrid LLM architectural patterns, training and prompting strategies, active human reinforcement learning supervised with AI, neuro-symbolic and structured knowledge grounding, program synthesis, iterated decomposition and others.",

      "content": "Research in the field of question answering could route from earliest examples of AI system designed to answer questions like ELIZA~\\citep{weizenbaumELIZAComputerProgram1966} developed at MIT in the 1960s; or engineering approaches to solve complex problems; or foundational research in the psychology field on how people understand and interpret language, prioritize and focus on relevant information in context~\\citep{cuadraOPENINGBLACKBOX1967, wilsonSituationalRelevance1973}, investigate and make decision, retrieve and use information from memory to answer~\\citep{normanMemoryKnowledgeAnswering1972}, innovate... Even Socrates' philosophical approach to questioning and critical thinking has recently been directly used to improve training~\\citep{pagnoniSocraticPretrainingQuestionDriven2022}, common sense reasoning~\\citep{jungMaieuticPromptingLogically2022}, or helping to solve some complex questions~\\citep{shridharAutomaticGenerationSocratic2022}. When a question or problem is too complex to be solved as it is, such as ``~how does the concept of personal freedom vary between different cultures and societies ?~'', a common strategy is to break it down into solvable questions, and then combine solutions to provide an overall answer if there is consensus, or the possible alternatives and nuances. We aim to answer complex questions, or problems formulated as a question, which are non-factoid and so require decomposition (multi-step), multi-source of knowledge combination, higher order reasoning or tasks resolution. All of these may vary a lot depending on the field and question. Neural language models recently demonstrated their ability to outperform an average human on different tasks across knowledge fields, and mimic methods or uncover appropriate methods for a given problem. However even most advanced systems will fail on some basic questions~\\citep{borjiCategoricalArchiveChatGPT2023}, or could assert totally false or biased knowledge without any caution. This can seriously impact the credibility of a system by a human. Involving humans in the question-answering loop, strengthening training, hybridizing with third parties like programs, symbolic AI or other, can greatly improves those models and help ensure ethical and safe outcomes. To be able to build those efficient hybrid systems, properly trained and aligned to human expectations in order to better solve increasingly complex problems, it is thus necessary to precisely know strengths and limitations of each language models alone or in collaboration. Therefore we use benchmarks and insights from collective papers as consensus baselines. Largest community edited papers HELM~\\citep{liangetal.HolisticEvaluationLanguage2022}, BLOOM~\\citep{bigscienceetal.BLOOM176BParameterOpenAccess2022} and BIG~\\citep{bigetal.ImitationGameQuantifying2022} focus on evaluating, democratizing and improving LLM capabilities, particularly on question answering and tasks that will also be useful for more complex questions. HELM provides a comprehensive analysis and benchmark for evaluating global strengths and weaknesses of reference large language models across a range of different scenarios and complementary metrics. Training large language models is done by resource-rich organizations and are mostly impossible to train by any individual public research group. BigScience~\\footnote{\\url{https://bigscience.huggingface.co/}}, a collaboration of hundreds of international researchers, trained on the French government-funded Jean Zay supercomputer during 3.5 months the largest open source multilingual language model called BLOOM and shared all models, codes and results in the BLOOM paper. BIG focus on spot and difficult capabilities to better assess current skills and limitations of language models. To overcome identified limitations and tackle more specific or complex questions, after those benchmarks and insights, we review hybrid architectural patterns solutions, training and prompting techniques, decomposition and reinforcement strategies to acquire the necessary knowledge, skills (general abilities), tasks (goal oriented actions), methods and human alignment.",

In \\autoref{sec_core_concepts}, we define key concepts that are necessary to understand the rest of the survey: definitions, typical process and architectures, new approach brought by large language models (LLM) and transformers. Next, we delve into complex QA definition, required tasks \\& skills, limitations to overcome (\\autoref{sec_skills_tasks_limits}) to answer complex questions. For each limitation we link to potential resolution strategies presented later. In \\autoref{sec_evaluation}, we review the evaluation metrics, methods and datasets of the scientific community used to assess current tasks, skills and limitations of LLM, or to further develop them through training. We then review the complementary resolving strategies which could be combined to solve complex QAs for the target usage. We first explore training techniques in \\autoref{sec_training}, including methods for dealing with lack of data, poor quality, and adaptation to new tasks and domains. Second, in \\autoref {sec_architectural_patterns}, we review and classify different hybridization architectural patterns with their pros and cons to augment LLM. Third, in \\autoref{sec_prompting}, we review prompting techniques and how it can also be used to decompose complex questions down to solvable tasks. Fourth, in \\autoref{sec_ImprovementLoop_and_kg_capitalization}, we review reinforcement techniques, continual learning, or how complex QA system might leverage its experience to solve more complex QAs. Finally, \\autoref{sec_limits_and_research} highlight tougher challenges, partial solutions that have been identified, and research avenues to overcome them.

From these elements, we systematically extracted the major concepts and their plans (table of contents). We fused all their plans into one to ensure a complete coverage of major concepts and adopt a similar methodology. \\textbf{Second}, we gathered: \\begin{enumerate} \\item[--] latest challenges from \\href{http://nlp.uned.es/clef-qa/}{CLEF QA (nlp.uned.es)}, \\href{https://research.nii.ac.jp/ntcir/}{NTCIR (research.nii.ac.jp)} and \\href{https://semeval.github.io/}{SemEval (semeval.github.io)} related to question answering; \\item[--] the list of the major conferences; then, list research papers from latest edition of conferences \\href{https://sigir.org/}{SIGIR (sigir.org)}, \\href{https://nips.cc/}{NeurIPS (nips.cc)}, \\href{https://naacl.org/}{NAACL (naacl.org)}, \\href{https://2022.emnlp.org/}{EMNLP (emnlp.org)}, \\href{https://iclr.cc/}{ICLR (iclr.cc)}, \\href{https://aaai.org/}{AAAI (aaai.org)}, \\href{https://www.ijcai.org/}{IJCAI (ijcai.org)}, \\href{https://www.cikm2022.org/}{CIKM (cikm2022.org)}, \\href{https://www.kdd.org/}{SIGKDD (kdd.org)}, \\href{https://www.wsdm-conference.org/}{WSDM (wsdm-conference.org)} about ``~complex question answering~'' and ``~language models~''; \\item[--] research publications from influential organizations in the field: \\href{https://www.deepmind.com/research}{Deepmind}, \\href{https://openai.com/publications/}{OpenAI}, \\href{https://research.google/pubs/}{Google}, \\href{https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publications/}{Microsoft}, \\href{https://research.facebook.com/publications/}{Meta} related to \"question answering\" and \"language models\". \\end{enumerate} From these enriched data we identified and clustered major challenges and solution patterns from the field and state-of-the-art: \\begin{enumerate} \\item[--] Domain adaptation or specialization, and maintenance. \\item[--] Decomposition (including multi-hop/step), question to search action design. \\item[--] Safety and data sensitivity, truthfulness, veracity and hallucinations, explainability. \\item[--] Reasoning (process, methods, chain of thought, code generation, causality). \\item[--] Scalability (inc. routing, space reduction). \\item[--] Alignment to human intentions, expectations and values (e.g. RLHF, clarifications and questions expansion). \\item[--] Long form question answering, long term dependency in reasoning, multi-document summarization. \\item[--] Dialog and context improvement (e.g. clarification question). \\item[--] Multimodal search (e.g. images, tables, audio). \\item[--] Time dimension reasoning. \\item[--] Biases reduction. \\end{enumerate} \\textbf{Third}, we enriched our bibliography using a search engine of scientific articles to identify all the articles published during the last four years on the main subject of this investigation (\\small{\\textit{search queries: \"complex question answering\" AND \"language model\"; \"question answering\" AND \"language model architecture\"; \"question answering\" AND \"language model\" AND \"hybrid architecture\"; \"hybrid language models\" OR \"hybrid language model\" OR \"hybrid neural language models\"; \"language model\" \"hybrid architecture\"}}).

      "section": "2.1 Definitions",
      "content": "In order to help the reader and to better define the scope of this study, we pose a set of definitions on the key concepts. As different definitions often exist for the same concept, we choose the one that best defines the scope of survey. \\begin{description} \\item [Question Answering (QA)] systems can answer questions from a specific or general knowledge base (limited / closed-domain, or public / open-domain QA). \\item [Complex question answering (CQA)] is to answer higher complexity questions. This complexity can come from the variety of skills required(\\ref{sec_skills_tasks_limits}) including multiple logic, higher reasoning (e.g. constraints solving, deduction, induction, abduction) and domain knowledge, answer format alignment and nuances handling in non-factoid questions, the need for decomposition and multi-step resolution, multiple sources of information to include and reason over on longer reasoning distance. \\item [Complex problem solving (CPS)] is to overcome barriers between a given state and a desired goal state by means of behavioral or cognitive multistep activities\\citep{frenschComplexProblemSolving1995}. A CPS process is split into two phases, knowledge acquisition and knowledge application. \\item [Question complexity] is a multidimensional construct that can be characterized by various aspects such as syntactic, lexical, semantic, discourse complexity, or cognitive complexity. We focus on this latest and consider the cognitive process required to answer a question, such as the level of concepts abstraction, the degree of reasoning, the amount and variety of knowledge, and the number of steps needed to find the answer. \\textbf{Non-factoid questions} (e.g. \"What are the causes of poverty in cities?\") are typically considered much more complex than factoid questions (e.g. \"What is the capital of Suriname ?\"). \\item [Information Retrieval (IR)] is the general task of retrieving information for a given query/subject. \\textbf{Semantic search} is the IR process of using natural language understanding techniques such as embedding to match the \"meaning\" of a query (rather than keywords) to the most relevant content in a corpus, regardless of the format of the content (e.g. structured or unstructured text, image...). \\item [Taxonomy of QA formats] is a proposed taxonomy~\\citep{rogersQADatasetExplosion2022} which covers question format, answer format, and source \\& evidence format. Question format can be in the form of natural language questions, queries, cloze format or story completion. Answer format can be in the form of extractive format, multi-choice/categorical format, freeform/generative format, or numerical. The source \\& evidence format can be in the form of unstructured text, semi-structured text, structured knowledge, images, audio, video or other combinations, and it can also be characterized by the amount of evidence provided, and whether it is from a single, multiple, partial or no source. \\item [Taxonomy of QA skills] is presented in a further section on elementary tasks \\& skills types. \\item [Prompt and instructions engineering VS pre-training and fine-tuning]: pre-training refers to training a model on a large corpus of data to learn general understanding of knowledge and logic; fine-tuning is the process of adapting a pre-trained model to a specific task with additional training on specific examples; prompt engineering is the technique of optimizing input question and optional instructions sent to a pre-trained model, potentially fine-tuned, without re-training it to improve the model's answer performance. \\item [End-to-end QA VS pipeline of specialized tasks]: an end-to-end QA uses a single call to a model to answer, while a pipeline uses multiple calls, often to specialized models, to deliver final answer. \\item [Multi-hop/Multi-step QA] is related to questions requiring reasoning over multiple pieces of evidence or multiple steps. It is often done after a question decomposition task or iteratively. \\item [(Neural) Language model] is a statistical model that predicts the likelihood of a sequence of words, or tokens, in a language. It can understand and generate human-like text or code, perform various language-related tasks and even non-textual tasks leveraging skills extracted from text or code~\\citep{haoLanguageModelsAre2022}. \\item [(Language model with) Knowledge in/out of model] is the distinction between a model with knowledge explicitly encoded inside the model, and a model using external knowledge (e.g. search engine, data sources, program). \\item [Standard/monomodal vs multimodal QA]: monomodal can search only one type of input (e.g text only) while multi-modal can search multiple types of input (text, image, video, sound...) \\item [Human-in-the-loop] is the practice of involving humans in the process to cover a processing task of getting feedback for improving system or processing a task instead of a system. Most frequent technique is RLHF (reinforcement learning with human feedback). \\item [Hallucinations] are confident generated responses including false information not justified by the model's training data. They are classified as extrinsic, when a model adds information that is not present in the source data, and intrinsic, when the model distorts information present in the source data into a factually incorrect representation~\\citep{choubeyCaPEContrastiveParameter2022}. \\item [Knowledge graphs (KG) \\& ontologies] are structured representations of knowledge (ontologies for concepts, KG for real-world objects) enabling to link and reason over knowledge. \\end{description}",

      "content": "From question capture and refinement, to answer generation and knowledge capitalisation, question answering (QA) or complex question answering (CQA) pipeline can follow a variable number of steps depending on architecture and features. Some steps are explicit and well separated, some can be implicit and fused with others in the same model operation. However, we can identify most frequent steps and options. The \"IBM DeepQA Architecture\" (see figure~\\ref{DeepQA Architecture}) seems a dated architecture compared to some current end-to-end neural language models but it defines clearly some major steps: \\begin{figure} \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{DeepQA.jpg} \\caption{IBM DeepQA Architecture (2010)~\\citep{ferrucciBuildingWatsonOverview2010} and CQA pipeline steps.} \\label{DeepQA Architecture} \\end{figure} \\begin{enumerate} \\item \\textbf{Question understanding} and analysis, it can include question and context refine, parsing and understanding the question, context, and intent (for task identification). It can also embed a dialogue management to interact with the user and understand the conversation context and state. \\item \\textbf{Query construction} with optional \\textbf{decomposition} of complex questions and multi-step queries. \\item \\textbf{Information retrieval (IR)} with optional knowledge base expansion - to add new knowledge to the system. \\item (a) \\textbf{Information extraction}, and (b) \\textbf{evaluation, scoring, ranking, filtering}. \\item \\textbf{Answer generation}, natural language or defined format (e.g. language program, table, ...) \\item \\textbf{Feedback loop \\& new knowledge capitalisation}: learning and improving from users and models feedback, plus storing linked and generated knowledge for improving answering skills. \\end{enumerate} This process is only a baseline as complex questions answering can be a dynamic and progressive process, and can also be collaborative. Architectures of QA systems have importantly evolved recently with the arrival of transformers architectures and large language models. We first quickly review typical modular architectures, then the transformers with large language models and, later, the hybrid architectures. Will we go to gigantic knowledge models or more complex and composed architectures, maybe in network of smaller specialized models and other components ?",

It led to language models surpassing humans on certain tasks. We can group current transformer based language models in three types~\\citep{lewisNaturalLanguageProcessing2022}: \\begin{description} \\item [Encoders only (e.g. BERT~\\citep{devlinBERTPretrainingDeep2019}, RoBERTa~\\citep{liuRoBERTaRobustlyOptimized2019})] encode a sequence of text (input) into a rich representation (vector embedding) which can be used by a task-specific model or function for classification, named entity recognition (NER), semantic similarity measure used in IR and QA or topic modeling. This is often called bidirectional attention, meaning they take the context of the words before and after the target word into account, which allows them to perform better on some tasks. BERT is one of the most well-known encoder-only models, and RoBERTa is an optimized version of BERT. \\item [Decoders only (e.g. GPT-3~\\citep{zongSurveyGPT32022})] complete an input sequence (mostly text prompt) by the most probable next words (generation). This left to right generation can be very rich like writing a story or answering a question (e.g. used by ChatGPT). The input prompt can be formatted with appropriate instructions (prompt \\& instructions engineering) to use the generated text as a task-specific model (e.g. classification, summarization, decomposition...). This is often called causal or autoregressive attention (non-causal decoders exist but has limited adoption in the literature). GPT family of models are one of the most well-known decoder-only models, known for their ability to generate human-like text. \\item [Encoders-Decoders (e.g. T5~\\citep{raffelExploringLimitsTransfer2020}, BART~\\citep{lewisBARTDenoisingSequencetoSequence2019}, BigBird~\\citep{zaheerBigBirdTransformers2021})] encode the input text and decode it into a different form (text-to-text mapping), they are suitable for translation, summarization, or generating a response to a question. They consist of both an encoder and a decoder, where the encoder generates a fixed-size representation of the input text, and the decoder generates the output text. T5 is known for its multi-tasks ability, BART is mainly used for text generation and summarization, and BigBird allows to process much longer sequence of texts than other models. \\end{description}",

In this section, we will discuss some of the most common metrics used to evaluate QA models: \\begin{description} \\item [Recall@k] Measures the proportion of relevant answers retrieved by the model among the top k answers. It is a measure of the model's ability to find all the relevant answers, regardless of their position in the ranking. The main weaknesses are that it does not take into account the position of the relevant answer in the ranking and does not penalize irrelevant answers that appear in the top k. \\item [Accuracy@k] Measures the proportion of correct answers among the top k answers returned by the model. It is a measure of the model's ability to return the correct answer and can be used to evaluate the performance of a model in a closed-domain QA task. As with recall@k, the main weaknesses are that it does not take into account the position of the correct answer in the ranking and does not penalize irrelevant answers that appear in the top k. \\item [nDCG] Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain, a measure of ranking quality that takes into account the relevance and position of answers. It is often used in information retrieval and web search to measure the effectiveness of a ranking algorithm. The main weaknesses are that it does not take into account the number of irrelevant answers in the ranking \\item [MAP] Mean Average Precision, a measure of the quality of a set of ranked answers. It is a commonly used metric for evaluating QA models in open-domain tasks, where the model must return a list of possible answers. its main weakness is that it does not take into account the position of the correct answer in the ranking. \\afterpage{% \\clearpage \\begin{landscape} \\begin{figure}[ht] \\centering \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{Table1QA_and_IR.jpg} \\caption{[HELM] SOTA QA multi-metrics (December 2022)} \\label{SOTA QA multi-metrics} \\end{figure} \\end{landscape} \\clearpage } \\item [MRR] Mean Reciprocal Rank, a measure of the quality of a set of ranked answers, with a higher value indicating better performance. It is often used in information retrieval and web search to measure the effectiveness of a ranking algorithm. Weakness: It only considers the position of the first correct answer in the ranking. \\item [CWS] Cross-entropy word-level perplexity, a measure of the model's ability to predict the next word in a sentence. It is often used to evaluate the quality of the language model. Weakness: it cannot be used for answer quality and perplexity is not well correlated with a language model tasks performance. \\item [F1 (Macro, Micro)] F1 score, a measure of a model's accuracy that takes into account both precision and recall. It is used to evaluate the model's performance in a classification task. F1 macro averages the per-class F1 scores, used for imbalanced datasets, F1 micro computes metrics globally by counting total true positives, false negatives, and false positives, used for balanced datasets. Weakness: It does not take into account the relative importance of false positives and false negatives. \\item [EM] Exact Match, a binary metric that measures whether the model's answer is exactly the same as the reference answer. It is often used in closed-domain QA tasks where the correct answer is a single word or phrase. Weakness: It is not able to capture the semantic similarity between the model's answer and the reference answer. \\item [Jacard similarity] measures similarity between two sets of data, based on the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sets. Weakness: It does not take into account the overall size of the sets, which can lead to errors in similarity measurements. \\item [Cosine similarity] measures similarity between two non-zero vectors based on the cosine of the angle between them. Weakness: It is sensitive to the magnitude of the vectors (e.g. zero), which can lead to errors in similarity measurements. \\item [BLEU] Bilingual Evaluation Understudy, a measure of the similarity between a model's answer and a reference answer. It is commonly used in machine translation and natural language generation tasks. Weakness: It does not take into account the meaning of the words (semantic similarity). \\item [ROUGE] Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation, a measure of the similarity between a model's answer and a reference answer. It is commonly used in natural language summarization tasks. Additionally to BLEU, it takes into account the longest common sequence (LCS). Weakness: it does not take into account the meaning of the words (semantic similarity). \\item [METEOR] Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering, a measure of the similarity between a model's answer and a reference answer. It is similar to BLEU, but takes into account word alignment and synonymy. Weakness: It is computationally expensive and can be sensitive to the reference translations used. \\item [Human evaluation] human judges provides a subjective measure of the quality of the model's answers. It is considered the gold standard for evaluating QA models. Weakness: it is time-consuming and can vary greatly depending on the individual evaluators and their level of expertise. \\end{description}",

It claims to better correlate with human judgement and identify quality differences. \\item [T5Score] this hybrid metric~\\citep{qinT5ScoreDiscriminativeFinetuning2022} based on mT5 model is not yet compared to date with MAUVE but is globally more robust than BERTScore and BARTScore. \\end{description} However the paper \"\\textit{On the Blind Spots of Model-Based Evaluation Metrics for Text Generation}\"~\\citep{heBlindSpotsModelBased2022} (2022) highlights that all those PLM based metrics have flaws, they could assign a high likelihood to degenerate, repetitive text and could be insensitive to perturbations such as word order shuffling, negation, etc. So those blind spots should be taken in account to compose and eval~\\citep{frisoniNLGMetricverseEndtoEndLibrary2022} the best metric for targeted complex QA application.",

      "content": "The Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM~\\citep{liangetal.HolisticEvaluationLanguage2022}), after referencing a large space of targeted use cases of LLM with a focus on QA, has identified 7 key categories of metrics required to create useful systems: accuracy, calibration, robustness, fairness, bias, toxicity, and efficiency (speed/cost). For accurate definition of theses categories of metrics please refer to HELM taxonomy~\\citep{liangetal.HolisticEvaluationLanguage2022}. From data provided by this project, we created a new table (see \\textbf{[HELM] SOTA QA multi-metrics} \\ref{sec_metricsSOTA}) assessing best performing models on each of this metrics in QA and a systematic comparison with the current global best performer (REF). We can see that performance of models are unequal and even best performer is not the best choice depending on metrics preference regarding your needs. The best performing model in these metrics was InstructGPT from OpenAI~\\citep{chiusanoOpenAIInstructGPTBrings2022}. A much smaller model (Anthropic-LM v4-s3) is close to the leading model which means it should cost much less to operate. The study observed a consistent gap between the current open models and non-open models in terms of accuracy. The gap has been reducing with the recent release of open models such as BLOOM (176B size)~\\citep{bigscienceetal.BLOOM176BParameterOpenAccess2022} by BigScience, OPT (175B size)~\\citep{zhangOPTOpenPretrained2022} by Meta, and GLM (130B size)~\\citep{zengGLM130BOpenBilingual2022} by Tsinghua University. Study shows that instruction-tuning can provide a broad set of advantages in terms of accuracy, robustness, and fairness metrics. The relationship between accuracy and calibration depends on the scenario (task \\& domain) and adaptation procedure, with some scenario showing trade-offs between accuracy and calibration. Across all scenarios, there is a strong correlation between accuracy, robustness, and fairness, but trade-offs where the most accurate model is not the most robust or fair. The study also found performance disparities in models when demographic metadata is available, and low overall average biases and toxicity in model generations, but notes that targeted evaluations are needed to obtain a more detailed characterization. The study also found that there is not a strong trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, but as models become larger, accuracy improves but with higher training and inference cost. Only a subset of all models are on the accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier for each scenario. There is no model leading on all metrics, QA performances also vary depending on the scenario (task \\& domain) and model, so weighting or defining a decision tree among the 7 metrics then evaluating on target scenario is necessary for choosing your model.",

Metrics identified in previous section for free-form QA could be used when there is a gold/reference answer but shall be unstable considering that a good non-factoid answer can be semantically distance to gold answer. In this survey we aim to answer complex questions with the following characteristics: non-factoid, multi-step (requiring decomposition), multi-source of knowledge, higher order of reasoning questions. We could separately measure each skill of a language model on those characteristics to estimate the capacity to answer using decomposition. Using data from BIG bench, we created a summary evaluation of similar QA capacities (see figure \\ref{Table [BIG] QA complex QA} [BIG] QA complex QA tasks benchmark). However, it will not assess the end-to-end capacity to provide a relevant final answer.

It is not used alone but to further improve a model like in continual pretraining, to learn sentence-level semantics. Different techniques exist such as next-sentence prediction NSP~\\citep{devlinBERTPretrainingDeep2019}, sentence order prediction SOP~\\citep{lanALBERTLiteBERT2020}, simple contrastive learning with SimCSE~\\citep{gaoSimCSESimpleContrastive2022} or SimCLR~\\citep{chenSimpleFrameworkContrastive2020} or MoCo-v2~\\citep{chenImprovedBaselinesMomentum2020}, bootstrapping with BYOL~\\citep{grillBootstrapYourOwn2020}, cross lingual contrastive pretraining with XLCo~\\citep{chiInfoXLMInformationTheoreticFramework2021}. \\item [Adversarial SSL] learns by distinguishing corrupted tokens (replaced or shuffled), can be used alone or in continual pretraining like contrastive. Different techniques exist: replaced token detection (RTD - used by ELECTRA model), multi-lingual replaced token detection (MRTD) is used by XLM-E model, translation replaced token detection (TRTD), shuffled token detection (STD) is used by RoBERTa model. \\item [Hybrid SSL] uses more than one type of SSL - e.g. U-Palm uses up to 7 denoising objectives (\\textbf{mixtures-of-denoisers~\\citep{tayUL2UnifyingLanguage2022}}), BERT uses MLM (generative) and NSP (contrastive), ALBERT used MLM and SOP (contrastive), infoXLM uses MLM + TLM (generative) and XLCo (contrastive).

A model can be very efficient on a given knowledge domain but will be later enable to process new questions requiring new or updated facts, this highlights the need for continual knowledge update in models which can be covered with continual learning technique~\\citep{yuanUnifiedQuestionGeneration2022, scialomFinetunedLanguageModels2022}.",

      "content": "\\citep{wangPuttingHumansNatural2021} Human-in-the-loop is meant to improve the outcome of an event or process via user input in the system loop. Humans can intervene at many steps in a QA system from task definition or data creation, to final answer assessment. We focus on the QA feedback loops. Human can explicitly validate, rank, correct, provide guidance for improvement, or implicitly rate via click-through. The outcome of each question expect the answer to best fit with the user\u2019s intention~\\citep{leikeScalableAgentAlignment2018}. Those intentions are explicit on one side (following instructions) and implicit on the other side (answer is helpful, truthful, not biased, nor toxic, nor harmful)~\\citep{askellGeneralLanguageAssistant2021, baiTrainingHelpfulHarmless2022}. We therefore need to: \\begin{itemize} \\item capture user rich explicit and implicit feedback through different human-in-the-loop input feedback. \\item estimate and maximize user explicit and implicit intentions satisfaction for each answer and also in total through diverse reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. \\end{itemize} This approach is often called RLHF (reinforcement learning with human feedback)~\\citep{ouyangTrainingLanguageModels2022, baiTrainingHelpfulHarmless2022, daniels-kochExpertiseProblemLearning2022, anonymousTaskAmbiguityHumans2022, ganguliRedTeamingLanguage2022, baiConstitutionalAIHarmlessness2022}, it can be enhanced by an AI supervision process to better scale, reduce human workload and biases, this is illustrated in the figure~\\ref{RLHF CAI}. \\begin{figure} \\includegraphics[width=1.0\\linewidth]{FromRLHFtoRLAIF.pdf} \\caption{From reinforcement learning with human feedback to AI feedback in order to scale and maximize helpfulness vs harmless tradeoff (\\citet{ouyangTrainingLanguageModels2022, baiConstitutionalAIHarmlessness2022})} \\label{RLHF CAI} \\end{figure} When compared to GPT-3 with 175B parameters, best in class language model in 2022, to model InstructGPT 1.3B more than 100 times smaller, prompt answers from this small model built with RLHF are 85\\% preferred by humans~\\citep{ouyangTrainingLanguageModels2022} . However, learning from human expertise has limits: \\begin{enumerate} \\item \\textbf{scaling cost selection}: manual labeling of data is slow and expensive so maybe restricted to some wealthy organizations or labeled with less expertise. To highly reduce this, \\citet{suSelectiveAnnotationMakes2022} proposes vote-k an unsupervised graph-based selective annotation method yielding to drast reduction and more robust learning, Anthropic et al~\\citep{baiConstitutionalAIHarmlessness2022} introduce different supervised and RL techniques (SL-CAI and RL-CAI summarized to RLAIF (RL with AI feedback)) which can learn from far fewer labelers and generate higher quality labeling. \\item \\textbf{labeler biases}: longer RLHF training can bias language model with stronger political views (e.g. gun rights, immigration) and desires to pursue specific goals (e.g. resource acquisition) and their preservation~\\citep{perezDiscoveringLanguageModel2022}. AI supervision from Anthropic~\\citep{baiConstitutionalAIHarmlessness2022} driven by principles could allow more controllable and transparent feedback behaviors. \\item \\textbf{expertise problem}: even if same questions are challenged by different persons and agreed with majority, some questions may require specific expertise to be correctly analyzed. Problem formalization and query-teacher selection solution is discussed in \"The Expertise Problem: Learning from Specialized Feedback\"~\\citep{daniels-kochExpertiseProblemLearning2022}. \\item \\textbf{harmlessness vs helpfulness trade-off}: \"helpfulness tends to increase harmfulness, since models are willing to obey pernicious requests, and conversely models trained to be harmless tend to be more evasive and generally less helpful\"~\\citep{baiConstitutionalAIHarmlessness2022}.

After reviewing the collected literature and identifying different solutions in this study, some limits seem tougher research limits to enable more complex QA and problems solving: \\begin{itemize} \\item The hallucination problem which limits a clear expectation of credibility/truthfulness in \"Alignment to human expectation \\& values in answer\". \\item The scalability problem which we can extend to compute and costs limits. \\item Data availability \\& quality which limits \"domain adaptation \\& task specialization\" and \"bias\" \\item Data multi-sensitivity in LLM: this point is nearly uncovered. \\item Question decomposition of very complex problems and its explainability. \\end{itemize} A recent paper from Meta\\citep{mialonAugmentedLanguageModels2023} surveys LLM augmentation with more details on reinforcement learning. It also proposes additional research topics such as an optimal tradeoff between getting knowledge in or out of the model, which would help to better design modules presented in section \\ref{sec_architectural_patterns}), and to extend LLM decomposition and planning module presented in section \\ref{sec_architectural_patterns} to be a central orchestrator.",

It predicts without giving clues about which part of a false claim goes wrong, even sources given are not trustworthy.

Operational costs for usage (inference) are less impressive~\\citep{liangetal.HolisticEvaluationLanguage2022} but limits the use cases considering inference latency and minimal required hardware. We can apply standard model size reductions like quantization, distillation, pruning, early stopping at training... Different research avenues try to reduce this computing and costs required and inverse this scaling law : \\begin{itemize} \\item \\textbf{Frozen PLM techniques}: we presented in previous sections prompt tuning and parameters-efficient tuning, there is a constant research on this related approach re-using already trained (frozen) LLM to avoid re-training it or at minimal. \\item \\textbf{Retrieval augmented LLM}: keeping a maximum of information out of model while making it easy to access and update without any re-train has an important potential but is often less efficient and may require equal computation when comparing \"total additional answer generation time\" vs \"training\", new techniques try to close the gap~\\citep{dejongPrecomputedMemoryOnthefly2023}. \\item \\textbf{Scaling in-context learning}: in-context learning highly improves tasks efficiency without re-training but is limited by maximum length input constraints due to quadratic complexity in computation and memory, different techniques allow to efficiently scale it~\\citep{haoStructuredPromptingScaling2022, choPromptAugmentedLinearProbing2022, martinsInftyFormerInfinite2022}. \\item \\textbf{Mixture of denoisers}: in \"Transcending Scaling Laws with 0.1\\% Extra Compute\"~\\citep{tayTranscendingScalingLaws2022}, same model is train at half the budget to reach the same performance using mixture-of-denoisers (\" U-PaLM achieves the same performance as the final PaLM 540B model at around half its computational budget - saving approx. 4.4 million TPUv4 hours\"). UL2, proposes an unification of LM learning paradigms~\\citep{tayUL2UnifyingLanguage2022}. \\item \\textbf{Improve pruning techniques}: in \"SparseGPT: Massive Language Models Can Be Accurately Pruned in One-Shot\"~\\citep{frantarSparseGPTMassiveLanguage2023}, same model can be reduced more than 50\\% parameters with only one-shot, without any retraining, and nearly no loss in accuracy. \\item \\textbf{Mixture of experts, parameters sharing and routing techniques}: \"Switch Transformers: Scaling to Trillion Parameter Models with Simple and Efficient Sparsity\"~\\citep{fedusSwitchTransformersScaling2022} demonstrated the usage of internal routing to expert layers in large language models to limit compute to part of the whole model to allow to scale model without augmenting compute. Many researchers propose new MoE: HetuMoE~\\citep{nieHetuMoEEfficientTrillionscale2022}, MoE distributed training system~\\citep{nieHetuMoEEfficientTrillionscale2022}, evolutional EvoMoE using dense-to-sparse gates~\\citep{nieEvoMoEEvolutionalMixtureofExperts2022}, FlexMoE with dynamic device placement~\\citep{nieFlexMoEScalingLargescale2023}. \\item \\textbf{Knowledge distillation} improvement~\\citep{blakeneyReduceReuseRecycle2022, zaheerTeacherGuidedTraining2022, wahleCohesiveDistillationArchitecture2023} and \\textbf{dynamic composition} of model~\\citep{xuSurveyDynamicNeural2022} to compose optimal and smaller models. \\item \\textbf{Adaptive computation and training}: all samples are equally computed in standard training.

These techniques can be applied to the input text, token embeddings, and sequence representations in order to protect the data from malicious actors. In addition, QA can ensure privacy by using secure protocols for matrix multiplication and complex non-linear functions such as Softmax, GELU activations, and LayerNorm. QA can also use TextHide which introduces an encryption step to prevent an eavesdropping attacker from recovering private text data. Finally, QA can use TextFusion which employs an adversarial training regime to privatize token representations and make it difficult to accurately recover the complete plain text. \\item \\textbf{Functional encryption}: this technique could use encryption to finely restrict data usage based on defined roles and functions (e.g. right to query medical data)~\\citep{xuPrivacyPreservingMachineLearning2021}. \\item \\textbf{Decentralized (federated) approach} with sensitive data: federated learning could allow to keep sensitive data at source to avoid sharing and unauthorized usage~\\citep{chenFedMatchFederatedLearning2021, xuPrivacyPreservingMachineLearning2021, xiaoOffsiteTuningTransferLearning2023}. \\item Other techniques~\\citep{xuPrivacyPreservingMachineLearning2021} could avoid elimination of data by perturbation, knowledge transfer... \\end{itemize}",

      "content": "We defined complex question answering as high complexity questions which are non-factoid, multi-step requiring decomposition, higher reasoning (constraints, deduction, induction, abduction), multi-source questions. This need for decomposition is central in this solving process because it breaks down a non solvable complex question (problem) down to solvable questions. Moreover, as we have seen in chain-of-thought and dynamic least-to-most, those traceable steps improve solving capacities of a given model but also makes the answer auditable, truthful and explainable in case of errors. However nearly all examples of papers reviewed related to decomposition are factoid questions. \\citet{duaSuccessivePromptingDecomposing2022} used \"\\textit{Who kicked the longest field goal in the first half?}\" as the main example of complex question, it is a factoid question. What if we ask \"\\textit{What are the most adapted LM hybrid architectures to answer complex questions ?}\". That would be a non-factoid question, requiring multiple sources, reasoning... And a compatible decomposition process aligned with an acceptable and auditable scientific methodology. We could learn this decomposition behaviour by cloning a human process~\\citep{yangChainThoughtImitation2022} or learn to discover it through a human contribution. Iterated decomposition~\\citep{reppertIteratedDecompositionImproving2023}, a human-in-the-loop workflow for process supervision using a language model allows to address new type of problems and enables users to inspect and intervene in the LM\u2019s reasoning process. Those two research topics seem of high potential even if it still requires a lot of human expert feedback, domain specific data and computation is an important limit. The generalization of such a process of decomposition for complex non factoid questions to many domains and practice could be accelerated by the same techniques identified for scaling RLHF, research avenues in \"Data availability \\& quality\", \"Compute, scaling... Costs\" and \"Hallucination \\& credibility\" sections; and improved with adapted shortest path iterative approach.",
