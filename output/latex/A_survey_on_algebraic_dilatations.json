A {\\it center in $A$} is a pair $[M,a]$ consisting of an ideal $M\\subset A$ and an element $a\\in A$. A {\\it multi-center} is a family of center indexed by some set. Let $I$ be an index set and let $\\{[M_i , a_i] \\}_{i \\in I}$ be a multi-center. For $i \\in I$, we put $L_i = M_i +(a_i)$, an ideal of $A$. Let $\\bbN _I $ be the monoid $\\bigoplus _{i \\in I} \\bbN $. If $\\nu = (\\nu_1 , \\ldots , \\nu_i, \\ldots ) \\in \\bbN _I $ we put $L^{\\nu}= L_1 ^{\\nu_1} \\cdots L_i ^{\\nu _i} \\cdots $ (product of ideals of $A$) and $a^{\\nu}= a_1^{\\nu_1 } \\cdots a_i ^{\\nu _i} \\cdots$ (product of elements of $A$). We also put $a^{\\bbN _I} = \\{ a^\\nu | \\nu \\in \\bbN _I \\}$. \\depr[{\\cite{Ma23d}}] \\label{generaldila} The dilatation of $A$ with multi-center $\\{[M_i , a_i] \\}_{i \\in I}$ is the unital commutative ring $A[\\big\\{ \\frac{M_i}{a_i}\\big\\}_{i \\in I}]$ defined as follows: $\\bullet$ The underlying set of $A[\\big\\{ \\frac{M_i}{a_i}\\big\\}_{i \\in I}]$ is the set of equivalence classes of symbols $\\frac{m}{a^{\\nu}} $ where $ \\nu \\in \\bbN _I$ and $m \\in L^{\\nu}$ under the equivalence relation \\[ \\frac{m}{a^\\nu} \\equiv \\frac{p}{a^{\\lambda}} \\Leftrightarrow \\exists \\beta \\in \\bbN _I \\text{ such that } ma^{\\beta + \\lambda }= p a^{\\beta + \\nu } \\text{ in } A.\\] From now on, we abuse notation and denote a class by any of its representative $\\frac{m}{a^{\\nu}}$ if no confusion is likely. $\\bullet$ The addition law is given by $\\frac{m}{a^{\\nu}}+ \\frac{p}{a^{\\beta}}= \\frac{m a^{\\beta } + p a^{\\nu}}{a^{\\beta + \\nu}}$. $\\bullet$ The multiplication law is given by $\\frac{m}{a^{\\nu}}\\times \\frac{p}{a^{\\beta}} = \\frac{ mp}{a^{\\nu + \\beta }}$. $\\bullet$ The additive neutral element is $\\frac{0}{1}$ and the multiplicative neutral element is $\\frac{1}{1}$. \\begin{flushleft} From now on, we also use the notation $A[\\frac{M}{a}]$ to denote $A[\\big\\{ \\frac{M_i}{a_i}\\big\\}_{i \\in I}]$.

      "content": "\\label{blow.up.definition.sec} Let $X$ be a scheme. Let $Clo (X)$ be the set of closed subschemes of $X$. Recall that $Clo(X)$ corresponds to quasi-coherent ideals of $\\calO _X$. Let $IQCoh(\\calO _X)$ denote the set of quasi-coherent ideals of $\\calO _X$. It is clear that $(IQCoh(\\calO _X), +, \\times , 0 , \\calO _X)$ is a semiring. So we obtain a semiring structure on $Clo (X)$, usually denoted by $(Clo(X), \\cap , + , X, \\emptyset)$. For clarity, we now recall directly operations on $Clo(X)$. Given two closed subschemes $Y_1,Y_2$ given by ideals $\\calJ _1 , \\calJ_2$, their sum $Y_1+Y_2$ is defined as the closed subscheme given by the ideal $\\calJ_1 \\calJ_2$. Moreover, if $n \\in \\bbN$, we denote by $nY_1$ the $n$-th multiple of $Y_1$. The set of locally principal closed subschemes of $X$ (cf. \\cite[\\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01WR}{Tag 01WR}]{stacks-project}), denoted $Pri(X)$, forms a submonoid of $(Clo(X),+)$. Effective Cartier divisors of $X$ \\cite[\\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/01WR}{Tag 01WR}]{stacks-project}, denoted $Car(X)$, form a submonoid of $(Pri (X),+)$. Note that $Car(X)$ is a face of $Pri(X)$. We have an other monoid structure on $Clo (X)$ given by intersection, this law is denoted $\\cap$. The operation $\\cap$ corresponds to the sum of quasi-coherent sheaves of ideals . The set $Clo(X)$ endowed with $ \\cap, +$ is a semiring whose neutral element for $+$ is $\\emptyset$ and whose neutral element for $\\cap$ is $X$. Let $C \\in Car(X) $, a non-zero-divisor (for $+$) in the semiring $Clo(X)$. Let $Y,Y' \\in Clo (X)$. If $C+Y$ is a closed subscheme of $C+Y'$, then $Y $ is a closed subscheme of $Y'$. Moreover if $C+Y=C+Y'$, then $Y=Y'$. Let $f:X' \\to X$ be a morphism of schemes, then $f$ induces a morphism of semirings $Clo(f) : Clo (X) \\to Clo (X'), Y \\mapsto Y \\times _X X'$, moreover $Clo(f) $ restricted to $(Pri (X),+)$ factors through $(Pri(X'),+)$, this morphism of monoids is denoted $Pri (f)$. In general the image of the map $Pri(f) |_{Car(X)}$ is not included in $Car (X'). $ Let $Y_1,Y_2 \\in Clo(X)$, we write $Y_1 \\subset Y_2$ if $Y_1 $ is a closed subscheme of $Y_2$. We obtain a poset $(Clo(X), \\subset)$. Let $Y_1,Y_2,Y_3 \\in Clo(X)$, if $Y_1 \\subset Y_2 $ and $Y_1 \\subset Y_3$ then $Y_1 \\subset Y_2 \\cap Y_3$. Let $Y_1,Y_2 \\in Clo (X)$, then $(Y_1 \\cap Y_2) \\subset Y_1$ and $Y_1 \\subset ( Y_1+Y_2)$. Finally, if $Y=\\{ Y_e \\} _{e \\in E}$ is a subset of $Clo (X)$ and if $\\nu \\in \\bbN ^{E}$, we put $Y^\\nu = \\{\\nu _e Y_e \\}_{e \\in E}$ and if moreover $\\nu \\in \\bbN _E$, we put $\\nu Y = \\sum _{e \\in E } \\nu _e Y_e$. \\defi[{\\cite[\u00a72.3]{MRR20} \\cite{Ma23d}}]\\label{defcatreg} Let $D= \\{ D_i \\} _{i \\in I}$ be a subset of $Clo (X)$.

If we deal with categories over a {\\it field}, and this is a somewhat well-known area with \\cite{deligne-milne82} being a fundamental reference, dilatations have not played a role. In the case we deal with categories which are linear over a {\\it discrete valuation} ring, a {\\it Dedekind domain}, or more complicated rings, the outputs are much scarcer and the main reference is the beautiful, yet arid, monograph \\cite{saavedra72}. But in this situation, dilatations have played a role. Following \\cite{dos_santos09}, N. D. Duong and P. H. Hai \\cite{duong-hai18} went into technical aspects of \\cite{saavedra72} and produced a more contemporaneous text to study tensor categories over Dedekind domain. This prompted further study \\cite{duong-hai-dos_santos18,hai-dos_santos21}; in these papers, the authors begin to look at N\\'eron blowups (in the sense of Section \\ref{neron}) and the resulting categories systematically. It is also useful to mention here the paper \\cite{csima-kottwitz10}, where the idea of looking at representation categories of N\\'eron blowups already appears. In this section we fix a discrete valuation ring $R$ with uniformizer $\\pi$, residue field $k$ and fraction field $K$.

This is to be replaced by the property that every object is a quotient of an ``object having a dual.'' That this property holds for representation categories of group schemes is \\cite[Proposition 3]{serre68}. (For a higher dimensional bases, see \\cite[Lema 2.5]{thomason87}.)

Using the fibre-by-fibre flatness criterion and \\cite{berthelot-ogus78}, one proves that an object $E\\in \\mathcal T^+$ is locally free if and only if it is $R$-flat.

      "content": "\\label{Tannak2} One obvious strategy to study Tannakian categories is to filter them by categories ``generated'' by a single object, just as in studying Galois groups it is fundamental to study finite extensions. Let $\\omega:\\mathcal T\\to R\\text{-}\\mathbf{mod}$ be as in the previous section so that $\\mathcal T$ is equivalent to $\\mathrm{Rep}_R(\\Pi)$ for some affine and flat group scheme $\\Pi$. We shall take this equivalence as an equality, but we warn the reader that the structure of $\\Pi$ should be considered as being very complicated (just as is that of an absolute Galois group). \\defi Let $M\\in\\mathcal T$ be an object possessing a dual $M^\\vee$ and for each couple of non-negative integers $a,b$, define $\\mathbf T^{a,b} M$ as $M^{\\otimes a}\\otimes M^{\\vee\\,\\otimes b}$. Then, $\\langle M\\rangle_\\otimes$ is the full subcategory of $\\mathcal T$ having as objects those which are quotients of subobjects of elements of the form \\[ \\mathbf T^{a_1,b_1}M\\oplus\\cdots\\oplus \\mathbf T^{a_r,b_r}M, \\] for varying $r$, $a_1,\\ldots,a_r$, $b_1,\\ldots,b_r$. The Tannakian group scheme associated to $\\langle M\\rangle_\\otimes$ via $\\omega$ shall will be called here the {\\it (full) Galois-Tannaka group (scheme)} of $M$. \\xdefi As we concentrate on a neutral Tannakian category, it is instructive to note that the splicing of $\\mathcal T$ by various $\\langle M\\rangle_\\otimes$ amounts to looking at various ``images'' of $\\Pi$. Before entering this topic, recall that, given a base field $F$ and a morphism $\\varphi:G'\\to G$ of affine group schemes over $F$, the closed image $\\mathrm{Im}_\\varphi$ \\cite[I.9.5]{EGA} is a {\\it closed subgroup scheme} of $G$ such that the natural morphism $G'\\to \\mathrm{Im}_\\varphi$ is {\\it faithfully flat} \\cite[Theorem on 15.1]{waterhouse79}. In this case, $\\mathrm{Im}_\\varphi$ enjoys both ``desirable properties'' of and image. \\begin{dfn}Let $\\rho:\\Pi\\to G$ be a morphism of flat and affine group schemes over $R$. Define the {\\it restricted} image of $\\rho$, denoted $\\mathrm{Im}_\\rho$, as the affine scheme associated to the algebra \\[ \\text{$B_\\rho$ = Image of $\\mathcal O(G)\\to \\mathcal O(\\Pi)$.} \\] (In other words, $\\mathrm{Im}_\\rho$ is the ``closed'' image of $\\rho$ \\cite[I.9.5]{EGA}.) Define its {\\it full} image $\\mathrm{Im}'_\\rho$ as being the affine scheme associated to \\[\\tag{\\S} B_\\rho'=\\{f\\in K\\otimes \\mathcal O(\\Pi)\\,:\\,\\text{ $\\pi^mf\\in B_\\rho$, for some $m\\ge0$}\\}. \\] \\end{dfn} It is not difficult to see that $\\mathrm{Im}_\\rho$ and $\\mathrm{Im}'_\\rho$ are affine group schemes. With these definitions, $\\rho$ factors as \\[\\tag{$\\dagger$} \\Pi \\stackrel \\psi\\longrightarrow \\mathrm{Im}'_\\rho \\stackrel u \\longrightarrow \\mathrm{Im}_\\rho \\stackrel \\iota\\longrightarrow G, \\] where $\\iota$ is a {\\it closed immersion} and $u$ induces an isomorphism between generic fibres. A fundamental result \\cite[Theorem 4.1.1]{duong-hai18} now assures that $\\psi$ is faithfully flat, so that the the terms ``images'' are justified and the factorization in $(\\dagger)$ is called the {\\it diptych} of $\\rho$. In addition, if \\[\\rho_K:\\Pi\\otimes K\\longrightarrow G\\otimes K\\] stands for the morphism obtained from $\\rho$ by base-change to $K$, we have \\[ \\mathrm{Im}'_\\rho\\otimes K=\\mathrm{Im}_\\rho\\otimes K=\\mathrm{Im}(\\rho_K). \\] \\begin{propo}[{\\cite[Proposition 4.10]{duong-hai-dos_santos18}}]\\label{05.06.2023--1jp} Let $M$ be a finite and free $R$-module affording a representation of $\\Pi$ and let $\\rho:\\Pi\\to \\mathrm{GL}(M)$ be the associated homomorphism. Then the obvious functor $\\mathrm{Rep}_R(\\mathrm{Im}'_\\rho)\\to\\mathrm{Rep}_R(\\Pi)$ defines an equivalence between $\\mathrm{Rep}_R(\\mathrm{Im}'_\\rho)$ and $\\langle M\\rangle_\\otimes$. Put differently, $\\mathrm{Im}'_\\rho$ is the Galois-Tannaka group of $M$ (in $\\mathrm{Rep}_R(\\Pi)$). \\end{propo} \\rema Let $\\mathrm{Rep}_R^\\circ(\\mathrm{Im}_\\rho)$ be the full subcategory of $\\mathrm{Rep}_R(\\mathrm{Im}_\\rho)$ consisting of objects having a dual; it is possible to show that $\\mathrm{Rep}_R^\\circ(\\mathrm{Im}_\\rho)$ is equivalent to a full subcategory of $\\langle M\\rangle_\\otimes$. On the other hand, the functor $\\mathrm{Rep}_R(\\mathrm{Im}_\\rho)\\to \\mathrm{Rep}_R(\\Pi)$ may easily fail to be full. \\xrema {\\it From now on, we give ourselves a representation $\\rho:\\Pi\\to \\mathrm{GL}(M)$} as in Proposition \\ref{05.06.2023--1jp}. It is at this point that the theory over $R$ parts from the theory over a field in a significant way. Indeed, in the case of a base-field, Galois-Tannaka group schemes are known to be of finite type \\cite[Proposition 2.20]{deligne-milne82}. {\\it This is not unconditionally true over $R$} since in order to construct $\\mathrm{Im}'_\\rho$, it was required to ``saturate'' the ring $B_\\rho$ in (\\S). On the other hand, the morphism $\\mathrm{Im}_\\rho\\to \\mathrm{GL}(M)$ is a closed immersion and $\\mathrm{Im}_\\rho$ is of finite type. \\defi A {\\it model} of a group scheme of finite type $G$ over $K$ is a flat group scheme $\\bbG$ over $R$ such that $\\bbG \\otimes_R K \\cong G$, as $K$-group schemes. We often identify $G$ and the generic fibre $\\bbG\\otimes_RK$. A morphism of models $\\bbG \\to \\bbG'$ of $G$ is a morphism $ \\bbG \\to \\bbG'$ of group schemes over $R $ which induces the identity on $G$ once unravelled the proper identifications. \\xdefi \\rema The definition of model used here differs from the one used in \\cite[\\href{https://stacks.math.columbia.edu/tag/0C2R}{Tag 0C2R}]{stacks-project} and \\cite{WW80} namely, we do not assume our models to be of finite type over $R$. \\xrema With this terminology, $\\mathrm{Im}_\\rho$ and $\\mathrm{Im}'_\\rho$ are models of $\\mathrm{Im}(\\rho_K)$. A well-known result of Waterhouse-Weisfeler about the relations between models is the following. \\begin{thm}[{\\cite[Theorem 1.4]{WW80}, \\cite[Theorem 2.11]{duong-hai-dos_santos18}}]\\label{thWW} Let $v:G' \\to G $ be a morphism of flat $S$-group schemes such that $v$ is an isomorphism on generic fibres. Then $v$ is a composite of mono-centered N\\'eron blowups (along the divisor defined by $\\pi$). In other words, a morphism of models of finite type is a composite of mono-centered N\\'eron blowups. If $G$ and $G'$ are of finite type, then the number of N\\'eron blowups is finite. More precisely: Define $v_0=v$ and $G_0=G$. Suppose that $v_n:G'\\to G_n$ is obtained and put \\[ G_{n+1}=\\mathrm{Bl}_{\\mathrm{Im}_{v_n\\otimes k}}^{G_n\\otimes k}(G_n). \\](Recall that $k$ is the residue field.) Letting $v_{n+1}:G'\\to G_{n+1}$ be the morphism deduced from the universal property of $\\mathrm{Bl}_{\\mathrm{Im}_{v_n\\otimes k}}^{G_n\\otimes k}(G_n)$ (cf. Proposition \\ref{Neron.blow.lemm}), then \\[ \\varprojlim_nv_n:G'\\longrightarrow \\varprojlim_nG_n \\] is an isomorphism. In particular, if for some $n\\in\\mathbb N$ the homomorphism $v_n\\otimes k$ is faithfully flat, then $G'\\simeq G_n$. \\end{thm} As was mentioned before, it is possible that $\\mathrm{Im}'_\\rho$ fails to be of finite type and hence the number of N\\'eron blowups proposed by Theorem \\ref{thWW} to describe $u:\\mathrm{Im}_\\rho'\\to\\mathrm{Im}_\\rho$ may be infinite. But in some cases, it does happen that the number of N\\'eron blowups is finite and a condition for this situation is described in Theorem \\ref{thWW}. At this point, we remind the reader that in the situations we have in mind, the group scheme $\\Pi$ is usually extremely complicated and the determination of the image of a morphism $\\Pi\\otimes k\\to G\\otimes k$, so that it is possible to apply the last claim in Theorem \\ref{thWW}, can only be achieved on the side of $\\mathrm{Rep}_R(\\Pi)$. It then becomes relevant to determine faithful representations of N\\'eron blowups. (Here, we say that a representation is {\\it faithful} if the morphism to the associated general linear group is a closed immersion. This is not universally adopted.) The next result explains how to proceed in certain cases. \\begin{thm}[{\\cite[Corollary 3.6]{duong-hai-dos_santos18}}]Let $G$ be an affine and flat group scheme of finite type over $S$. Let $M$ be a finite and free $R$-module affording a faithful representation of $G$. Given $m\\in M$, let \\[ H_0 =\\text{stabilizer of $m\\otimes1\\in M\\otimes k$} \\] in $G\\otimes k$. Let $G'=\\mathrm{Bl}_{H_0}^{G\\otimes k}(G)$. Then, letting $\\mathbbm1=R$ stand for the trivial representation of $G'$, the obvious map $\\mathbbm1\\to M\\otimes k$ determined by $1\\mapsto v\\otimes 1$ is $G'$-equivariant and the fibered product \\[\\tag{$\\P$} M':=M\\underset {M\\otimes k}{\\times}\\mathbbm1 \\] now affords a faithful representation of $G'$. \\end{thm} Let us illustrate the above result with a simple example showing how to compute a Galois-Tannaka group. \\begin{ex}Let $k$ be of characteristic zero and $\\mathcal T$ be the category of representations of the abstract group $\\mathbb Z$ on finite $R$-modules. It is not difficult to see that $\\mathcal T$ is neutral Tannakian \\cite[Corollary 4.5]{hai-dos_santos21}. Let $\\mathbb Z$ act on $M=R$ by $\\gamma\\cdot r=(1+\\pi)^\\gamma r$ and write $\\rho:\\Pi\\to \\mathrm{GL}(M)(\\simeq\\mathbb G_{m,R})$ for the associated morphism of group schemes. It is not difficult to see that $\\mathrm{Im}_\\rho=\\mathbb G_{m,R}$ and we wish to compute $\\mathrm{Im}_\\rho'$. As mentioned above, the construction ($\\S$) is of little use. On the other hand, we know that $\\Pi$ will act trivially on $M\\otimes k$ because $\\mathbb Z$ does. We then need to perform the ``dilatation'' $M'$ of $M$ as in $(\\P)$, which is a faithful representation of the N\\'eron blowup $\\mathrm{Bl}_{\\{e\\}}^{\\mathbb G_m\\otimes k}(\\mathbb G_m)$. The elements $m_1:=(\\pi,0)$ and $m_2:=(1,1)$ obviously form a basis for $M'$ and hence the resulting representation of $\\mathbb Z$ is defined by \\[ \\gamma\\longmapsto\\begin{pmatrix}1+\\pi&1\\\\0&1\\end{pmatrix}^\\gamma. \\] If $\\rho':\\Pi\\to \\mathrm{GL}(M')(\\simeq \\mathrm{GL}_2)$ stands for the associated representation of $\\Pi$, we can say that $\\begin{pmatrix}1&1\\\\0&1\\end{pmatrix}\\in\\mathrm{GL}_2(k)$ belongs to the image of $\\rho'\\otimes k$ and therefore $\\mathrm{Im}_\\rho'\\simeq\\mathrm{Bl}_{\\{e\\}}^{\\mathbb G_m\\otimes k}(\\mathbb G_m)$ because $\\mathrm{Bl}_{\\{e\\}}^{\\mathbb G_m\\otimes k}(\\mathbb G_m)\\otimes\\simeq\\mathbb G_{a,k}$, and any element of $k\\setminus\\{0\\}$ generates a dense subgroup. \\end{ex} On the other hand, when the number of N\\'eron blowups envisaged by Theorem \\ref{thWW} is infinite, a general principle behind \\cite{duong-hai-dos_santos18, hai-dos_santos21} is that the Galois-Tannaka groups can be obtained from group schemes of finite type via certain special types of (what we now call) {\\it multi-centered} N\\'eron blowups.

If $\\calO$ is local or $G$ is affine, there is a canonical and functorial isomorphism of groups: \\[\\tag{$\\star$} G_s(\\calO)/G_r(\\calO) \\isomto \\frakg_s(\\calO)/\\frakg_r(\\calO). \\] \\xtheo \\rema \\label{rem1iso} We comment on works prior to Theorem \\ref{moncong}. \\begin{enumerate} \\item In the case of an affine, smooth group scheme over a discrete valuation ring, the isomorphism of Theorem~\\ref{moncong} appears without proof in \\cite[proof of Lemma 2.8]{Yu15}. \\item The proof of Theorem \\ref{moncong} relies on Proposition \\ref{exceptional divisor} and Theorem \\ref{theo:dilatations of subgroups} whose proofs (given in \\cite[Prop. 2.9]{MRR20} and \\cite[Th. 3.5]{MRR20}) basically consist in playing and computing with quasi-coherent ideals. These computations on quasi-coherent ideals in \\cite{MRR20} were partly motivated by related computations on ideals done in the affine case in \\cite[Appendix A]{Ma19t} to understand the congruent isomorphism. The statement of \\cite[Th. 3.5]{MRR20} is moreover partly inspired by \\cite[Th. 1.5, Th. 1.7]{WW80}. \\item If $G=\\mathbb G_m/\\bbZ_p$, isomorphism ($\\star$) follows from the multiplicative structure of $\\bbZ _p $ cf. e.g. \\cite{He1913}, \\cite{Ha50} and \\cite[Chap. 15]{Ha80}. Similar isomorphisms for matrix groups over non-Archimedean local fields were used in \\cite[p.~442 line 1]{Ho77}, \\cite[2.13]{Mo91}, \\cite[p.~22]{BK93}, \\cite[p.~337]{Sec04} and many other references to study admissible representations of $p$-adic classical groups. In the matrix case, the filtrations involved are defined using matrix theoretic descriptions and avoiding scheme theoretic tools. For general reductive groups over non-Archimedean local fields, such kind of isomorphisms were introduced and used in \\cite[\\S2]{PR84}, \\cite[\\S2]{MP94}, \\cite{MP96}, \\cite[\\S1]{Ad98}, \\cite[\\S1]{Yu01} to study admissible representations. In the reductive case, the filtrations involved are the Moy-Prasad filtrations \\cite{MP94}, \\cite{MP96} and the isomorphism is called the Moy-Prasad isomorphism. These filtrations are defined for points in the Bruhat-Tits building using the associated valued root datum \\cite{BT72} \\cite{BT84}. The Moy-Prasad isomorphim in these references was defined using somehow ad hoc formulas and the valued root datum, in particular avoiding the congruent isomorphism. However it is known that one has to modify the original Moy-Prasad filtrations to ensure the validity of the Moy-Prasad isomorphism in full generality, cf. \\cite[\u00a70.3]{Yu15} and \\cite[\u00a713]{KP22}. \\end{enumerate} \\xrema If $G = \\mathrm{GL}_2 /\\bbZ_p $, $G_n (\\bbZ_p) =\\begin{pmatrix}1+\\frakp^n & \\frakp^n\\\\ \\frakp^n & 1+ \\frakp^n \\end{pmatrix} \\subset \\mathrm{GL}_2 (\\bbZ _p) $ and $\\mathfrak{g} _n (\\bbZ_p)=\\begin{pmatrix}\\frakp^n & \\frakp^n \\\\ \\frakp^n & \\frakp^n \\end{pmatrix} \\subset M_2 (\\bbZ_p)$ for any $n>0$. The isomorphism $(\\star)$ gives us, for pairs $(r,s)$ such that $0 < \\frac{r}{2} \\leq s \\leq r $, isomorphisms \\[ \\tag{$ * $} \\begin{pmatrix}1+\\frakp^s & \\frakp^s\\\\ \\frakp^s & 1+ \\frakp^s \\end{pmatrix} / \\begin{pmatrix}1+\\frakp^r & \\frakp^r \\\\ \\frakp^r & 1+ \\frakp^r \\end{pmatrix} \\cong \\begin{pmatrix}\\frakp^s & \\frakp^s \\\\ \\frakp^s & \\frakp^s \\end{pmatrix} / \\begin{pmatrix}\\frakp^r & \\frakp^r \\\\ \\frakp^r & \\frakp^r \\end{pmatrix}.\\] These maps are given by $[1+M] \\mapsto [M]$. Using the formula $ [1+M] \\mapsto [M] $, it is elementary to check that we have other isomorphisms of abstract groups \\begin{align*} \\tag{$ ** $} \\begin{pmatrix}1+\\frakp^3 & \\frakp^3\\\\ \\frakp^3 & 1+ \\frakp^3 \\end{pmatrix} / \\begin{pmatrix}1+\\frakp^5 & \\frakp^6 \\\\ \\frakp^6 & 1+ \\frakp^5 \\end{pmatrix} \\cong \\begin{pmatrix}\\frakp^3 & \\frakp^3 \\\\ \\frakp^3 & \\frakp^3 \\end{pmatrix} / \\begin{pmatrix}\\frakp^5 & \\frakp^6 \\\\ \\frakp^6 & \\frakp^5 \\end{pmatrix},\\\\ \\tag{$***$}\\begin{pmatrix}1+\\frakp^3 & \\frakp^9\\\\ \\frakp^3 & 1+ \\frakp^3 \\end{pmatrix} / \\begin{pmatrix}1+\\frakp^6 & \\frakp^9 \\\\ \\frakp^6 & 1+ \\frakp^6 \\end{pmatrix} \\cong \\begin{pmatrix}\\frakp^3 & \\frakp^9 \\\\ \\frakp^3 & \\frakp^3 \\end{pmatrix} / \\begin{pmatrix}\\frakp^6 & \\frakp^9 \\\\ \\frakp^6 & \\frakp^6 \\end{pmatrix}. \\end{align*} These isomorphisms are obtained as follows from the point of view of dilatations. \\theo[\\cite{Ma23d}] \\label{isocorocongru} (Multi-centered congruent isomorphism) Let $G$ be a separated and smooth group scheme over $S$. Let $H_0 \\subset H_1 \\subset \\ldots \\subset H_k$ be closed subgroup schemes of $G$ such that $H_i$ is smooth over $S$ for $0 \\leq i \\leq d$ and $H_0=e_G$.

Let $ e_G \\subset G$ be the trivial subgroup. Let $T$ be the diagonal split torus in $G$. Let $B$ be the lower triangular Borel in $G$ over $\\bbZ_p$. \\begin{enumerate} \\item The isomorphism $(**)$ above is given by Theorem \\ref{isocorocongru} with $(\\calO , \\pi ) =(\\bbZ _p, \\mathfrak{p} )$, $H_0=e_G$, $H_1= T$, $s_0 =3, s_1=3, r_0= 5 $ and $r_1=6$. \\item The isomorphism $(***)$ above is given by Theorem \\ref{isocorocongru} with $(\\calO , \\pi )= (\\bbZ _p, \\mathfrak{p} )$, $H_0=e_G$, $H_1= B$, $s_0 =3, s_1=9, r_0= 6 $ and $r_1=9$. \\end{enumerate} \\rema We comment Theorem \\ref{isocorocongru}. \\begin{enumerate} \\item Theorem \\ref{isocorocongru} corresponds to \\cite[Corollary 8.3]{Ma23d}, a slightly more general result is given by \\cite[Theorem 8.1]{Ma23d}. \\item The proof of Theorem \\ref{isocorocongru} given in \\cite{Ma23d} relies on Theorem \\ref{moncong} and the study of multi-centered dilatations. \\item Note that \\cite[Lemma 1.3]{Yu01} provides a comparable \"multi-centered\" isomorphism, in the framework of reductive groups over non-Archimedean local field. \\end{enumerate} \\xrema Recall that dilatations of schemes over discrete valuation rings are used in Yu's approach \\cite{Yu15} on Bruhat-Tits theory for reductive groups over henselian discrete valuation field with perfect residue field. We refer to the monograph by Kaletha and Prasad \\cite{KP22} that include among other things a detailled exposition of \\cite{Yu15}. The congruent isomorphism (Theorem \\ref{moncong}) and its proof (relying on several results of \\cite{MRR20}) are now used as foundation to prove the Moy-Prasad isomorphism for reductive groups mentioned in Remark \\ref{rem1iso}, cf. \\cite[Theorem 13.5.1 and its proof, Proposition A.5.19 (3) and its proof]{KP22}. As a consequence, dilatations and congruent isomorphisms are now part of the foundation to study admissible representations of reductive $p$-adic groups. Furthermore, other connections between dilatations and groups used to study admissible representations can be found in \\cite[\u00a710]{Yu15} and \\cite[Example 1.4]{Ma23d}. Reciprocally, the problem of constructing supercuspidal representations of $p$-adic groups (cf. e.g. \\cite[Remark/Conclusion]{Ma19o}, \\cite{Ma19t, MY22}), or more generally types in the sense of \\cite{BK98}, could continue to be a source of inspiration to expend the theory of dilatations. \\rema As we explained before, the book \\cite{KP22} provides a carefully written new approach to Bruhat-Tits theory in the case of discrete valuations. This beautiful monograph uses the theory of dilatations to deal with integral models whereas the original Bruhat-Tits theory \\cite{BT84} did not. Let us quote \\cite[Introduction]{KP22}: \\begin{center} ``\\textit{Next we turn to the construction of integral models [...]. Instead of using the approach of Bruhat\u2013Tits via schematic root data, we employ a simpler and more direct method due to Jiu-Kang Yu \\cite{Yu15}, based on the systematic use of N\\'eron dilatations.}'' \\end{center} The book \\cite{KP22} offers an appendix on dilatations. Though \\cite[Appendix A.5]{KP22} takes into account the treatment of dilatations in \\cite{MRR20}, it restricts to the framework of discrete valuations. Originally, Bruhat-Tits theory \\cite{BT84} deals also with non discrete valuations, it is natural to ask whether the modern and general approach to dilatations of schemes initiated in \\cite{MRR20} could help to provide a more conceptual treatment (in the spirit of \\cite{Yu15} and \\cite{KP22}) of some parts of \\cite{BT84}. Bruhat-Tits theory and dilatations over non discrete valuations were used in \\cite{RTW10} and \\cite{Ma22} to study Berkovich's point of view \\cite[Chap. 5]{Be90} on Bruhat-Tits buildings of reductive groups over discrete and non-discrete valuations (cf. e.g. \\cite[1.3.4]{RTW10} for precise assumptions). \\xrema",

      "content": "\\label{Torsors.blowup.sec} \\label{TorShtuk} In this subsection, we explain that many level structures on moduli stacks of $G$-bundles are encoded in torsors under N\u00e9ron blowups of $G$ following \\cite{MRR20}. Assume that $X$ is a smooth, projective, geometrically irreducible curve over a field $k$ with a Cartier divisor $N\\subset X$, that $G\\to X$ is a smooth, affine group scheme and that $H\\to N$ is a smooth closed subgroup scheme of $G|_N$. In this case, the N\\'eron blowup $\\calG\\to X$ is a smooth, affine group scheme. Let $\\Bun_G$ (resp.~$\\Bun_\\calG$) denote the moduli stack of $G$-torsors (resp.~$\\calG$-torsors) on $X$. This is a quasi-separated, smooth algebraic stack locally of finite type over $k$ (cf.~e.g.~\\cite[Prop.~1]{He10} or \\cite[Thm.~2.5]{AH19}). Pushforward of torsors along $\\calG\\to G$ induces a morphism $\\Bun_\\calG\\to \\Bun_G$, $\\calE\\mapsto \\calE\\x^\\calG G$. We also consider the stack $\\Bun_{(G,H,N)}$ of $G$-torsors on $X$ with level-($H$,$N$)-structures, cf. \\cite[Definition 4.5]{MRR20}. Its $k$-points parametrize pairs $(\\calE,\\be)$ consisting of a $G$-torsor $\\calE\\to X$ and a section $\\be$ of the fppf quotient $(\\calE|_{N}/H)\\to N$, i.e., $\\be$ is a reduction of $\\calE|_N$ to an $H$-torsor. \\prop[\\cite{MRR20}] \\label{torsorprop} There is an equivalence of $k$-stacks \\[ \\Bun_\\calG\\;\\overset{\\cong}{\\longto}\\;\\Bun_{(G,H,N)},\\;\\; \\calE\\longmapsto (\\calE\\x^\\calG G,\\, \\be_{\\on{can}}), \\] where $\\be_{\\on{can}}$ denotes the canonical reduction induced from the factorization $\\calG|_N\\to H\\subset G|_N$. \\xprop Thus, many level structures are encoded in torsors under N\\'eron blowups. This construction is also compatible with the adelic viewpoint as follows. Let $|X|\\subset X$ be the set of closed points, and let $\\eta \\in X$ be the generic point. We denote by $F=\\kappa(\\eta)$ the function field of $X$. For each $x\\in |X|$, we let $\\calO_x$ be the completed local ring at $x$ with fraction field $F_x$ and residue field $\\kappa(x)=\\calO_x/\\frakm_x$.

      "content": "Constructing smooth complex affine varieties with controlled topology} Dilatations have played an important role in complex affine algebraic geometry during the nineties in connection to the construction and study of exotic complex affine spaces \\cite{KZ99,Zai00}, that is, smooth algebraic $\\mathbb{C}$-varieties $X$ of dimension $n$ whose analytifications $X^{\\mathrm{an}}$ are homeomorphic to the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ endowed with its standard structure of topological manifold but which are not isomorphic to the affine space $\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{n}$ as $\\mathbb{C}$-varieties. In this context, dilatations appeared under the name \\emph{affine modifications} and were used as a powerful tool to produce from a given smooth complex affine variety $X$ a new smooth complex affine variety $X'=\\mathrm{Bl}_{Z}^{D}X$ for which the homology or homotopy type of the underlying topological manifold of the analytification of $X'$ can determined under suitable hypotheses in terms of those of $X$ and of the center $\\{[Z,D]\\}$ of the dilatation. \\vspace{0.1cm} The study of the strong topology of affine modifications was initiated in this context mainly by Kaliman through an analytic counter part of the notion of dilatation: \\begin{dfn}[\\cite{Ka94}] Given a triple $(M,H,C)$ consisting of a complex analytic manifold $M$, a closed submanifold $C$ of $M$ of codimension at least $2$ and a complex analytic hypersurface $H$ of $M$ containing $C$ in its smooth locus, the \\emph{Kaliman modification $M$ along $H$ with center at $C$} is the complex analytic manifold defined as the complement $M'$ of the proper transform $H'$ of $H$ in the blow-up $\\sigma_{C}:\\hat{M}\\to M$ of $M$ with center at $C$. \\end{dfn} In the case where $(M,H,C)$ is the analytification of a triple $(X,D,Z)$ consisting of a smooth algebraic $\\mathbb{C}$-variety $X$, a smooth algebraic sub-variety $Z$ of $X$ of codimenion at least two and of a reduced effective Cartier divisor $D$ on $X$ containing $Z$ in its regular locus, the Kaliman modification of $(M,H,C)$ coincides with the analytification of the dilatation $X'=\\mathrm{Bl}_{Z}^{D}X$ of $X$ with center $\\{[Z,D]\\}$ of Section \\ref{333}. \\vspace{0.1cm} Kaliman and Zaidenberg \\cite{KZ99} developed a series of tools to describe the topology of the analytications of affine modifications of smooth affine $\\mathbb{C}$-varieties along principal divisors $D$ with non-necessarily smooth centers. One of these provides in particular a control on the preservation of the topology of the analytification under affine modifications: \\begin{thm}[{\\cite[Proposition 3.1 and Theorem 3.1]{KZ99}}] \\label{thm:Kaliman-Zaidenberg-MainThm} Let $X$ be a smooth affine $\\mathbb{C}$-variety and let $\\{[Z,D]\\}$ be a center on $X$ consisting of closed sub-scheme $Z$ of codimension at least $2$ and of a principal effective divisor $D$ containing $Z$ as a closed subscheme. Let $\\sigma:\\tilde{X}=\\mathrm{Bl}_{Z}^{D}(X)\\to X$ be the dilatation of $X$ with center $\\{[Z,D]\\}$ and let $E$ be the exceptional divisor of $\\sigma$. \\noindent Assume that the following conditions are satisfied: (i) The $\\mathbb{C}$-variety $\\tilde{X}=\\mathrm{Bl}_{Z}^{D}(X)$ is smooth; (ii) The divisors $E$ and $D$ are irreducible, $E=\\sigma^{*}D$, and the analytifications of $E_{\\mathrm{red}}$ and $D_{\\mathrm{red}}$ are topological manifolds. \\noindent Then the following properties hold: (a) The homomorphism $\\sigma_{*}^{\\mathrm{an}}:\\pi_{1}(\\tilde{X}^{\\mathrm{an}})\\to\\pi_{1}(X^{\\mathrm{an}})$ induced by $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{an}}$ is an isomorphism; (b) The homomorphism $\\sigma_{*}^{\\mathrm{an}}:H_{*}(\\tilde{X}^{\\mathrm{an}};\\mathbb{Z})\\to H_{*}(X^{\\mathrm{an}};\\mathbb{Z})$ induced by $\\sigma^{\\mathrm{an}}$ is an isomorphism if and only if the homomorphism $\\sigma|_{E,*}^{\\mathrm{an}}:H_{*}(E_{\\mathrm{red}}^{\\mathrm{an}};\\mathbb{Z})\\to H_{*}(D_{\\mathrm{red}}^{\\mathrm{an}},\\mathbb{Z})$ is. \\end{thm} \\begin{cor} \\label{cor:Main-cor-Top}In the setting of Theorem \\ref{thm:Kaliman-Zaidenberg-MainThm}, assume that $X^{\\mathrm{an}}$ is a contractible smooth manifold, that $Z_{\\mathrm{red}}^{\\mathrm{an}}$ is a topological manifold and that the homomorphism $$j_{*}^{\\mathrm{an}}:H_{*}(Z_{\\mathrm{red}}^{\\mathrm{an}};\\mathbb{Z})\\to H_{*}(D_{\\mathrm{red}}^{\\mathrm{an}};\\mathbb{Z})$$ induced by the closed immersion $j:Z\\hookrightarrow D$ is an isomorphisms. Then the analytification of $\\tilde{X}=\\mathrm{Bl}_{Z}^{D}(X)$ is a contractible smooth manifold. \\end{cor} Having the flexibility to use as centers or divisors of modifications schemes which are either non-reduced or whose analytifications are not necessarily smooth manifolds but only topological manifolds is particularly relevant for applications to the construction smooth $\\mathbb{C}$-varieties with contractible analytifications, as illustrated by the following examples. \\begin{ex}[The tom Dieck - Petrie surfaces] \\label{exa:.-tom-Dieck-Petrie-surfaces} Let $p,q\\geq2$ be a pair of relatively prime integers and let $C_{p,q}\\subset\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{2}=\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{C}[x,y])$ be an irreducible rational cuspidal curve with equation $x^{p}-y^{q}=0$. The underlying topological space of $C_{p,q}^{\\mathrm{an}}$ is a contractible real topological surface, and hence, Corollary \\ref{cor:Main-cor-Top} applies to conclude that the analytification of the dilatation $S_{p,q}=\\mathrm{Bl}_{(1,1)}^{C_{p,q}}\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{2}$ of $\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{2}$ along the principal Cartier divisor $D=C_{p,q}$ with center at the closed point $Z=(1,1)\\in C_{p,q}$ is a smooth contractible real $4$-manifold. The smooth affine surface $S_{p,q}$, which can be described explicitly as the hypersurface in $\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{3}=\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{C}[x,y,z])$ with equation \\[ \\frac{(xz+1)^{p}-(yz+1)^{q}}{z}=1, \\] is not isomorphic to $\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{2}$ since, for instance, it has non negative logarithmic Kodaira dimension \\cite[Example 2.4]{Zai00}. Moreover, the underlying real $4$-manifold of $S_{p,q}^{\\mathrm{an}}$ is an example of a contractible $4$-manifold with non-trivial fundamental group at infinity, hence non-homeomorphic to the standard euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{4}$. \\end{ex} \\begin{ex}[Some Koras-Russell threefolds] \\label{exa:-KR-threefolds} Let again $p,q\\geq2$ be a pair of relative prime integers and consider for every $n\\geq2$ the smooth hypersurface $X_{p,q,n}$ in $\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{4}=\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{C}[x,y,z,w])$ with equation \\[ x^{n}y+z^{p}+w^{q}+x=0. \\] The restriction $\\sigma_{p,q,n}:X_{p,q,n}\\to\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{3}$ of the projection to the coordinates $x$, $z$ and $w$ expresses $X_{p,q,n}$ as the dilatation of $\\mathbb{A}_{k}^{3}$ along the principal divisor $D_{n}=\\mathrm{div}x^{n}$ and with center at the non-reduced condimension closed sub-scheme $Z=Z_{p,q,n}$ with defining ideal $$I_{p,q,n}=(z^{p}+w^{q}+x,x^{n})\\subset\\mathbb{C}[x,z,w].$$ The analytification of $Z_{\\mathrm{red}}$ is a topological manifold homeomorphic to the underlying topological space of the curve $C_{p,q}^{\\mathrm{an}}$ of the previous example. Thus, Corollary \\ref{cor:Main-cor-Top} applies to conclude that $X_{p,q,n}^{\\mathrm{an}}$ is a contractible real $6$-manifold, hence, by a result of Dimca--Ramanujam, is diffeomorphic to the standard euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^{6}$, see \\cite[Theorem 3.2]{Zai00}. The interest in these affine threefolds $X_{p,q,n}$ was motivated in the nineties by their appearance in the course of the study of the linearization problem for actions of the multiplicative group $\\mathbb{G}_{m,\\mathbb{C}}$ on $\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{3}$ by Koras and Russell \\cite{KR97}. One crucial question at that time was to decide whether these threefolds were isomorphic to $\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{3}$ or not. The fact that none of them is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{3}$ was finally established by Makar-Limanov \\cite{ML96} by commutative algebra techniques. An interesting by-product of his proof is that the dilatation morphism $\\sigma_{p,q,n}:X_{p,q,n}\\to\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{3}$ is equivariant with respect to the natural action of the group of $\\mathbb{C}$-automorphism of $X_{p,q,n}$, more precisely, $\\sigma_{p,q,n}$ induces an isomorphism \\[ \\sigma_{p,q,n}^{*}:\\mathrm{Aut}_{\\mathbb{C}}(\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{3},\\{[Z_{p,q,n},D_{n}]\\})\\to\\mathrm{Aut}_{\\mathbb{C}}(X_{p,q,n}) \\] between the subgroup $\\mathrm{Aut}_{\\mathbb{C}}(\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{3},\\{[Z_{p,q,n},D_{n}]\\})$ of $\\mathrm{Aut}_{\\mathbb{C}}(\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{3})$ consisting of $\\mathbb{C}$-automorphisms preserving the divisor and the center of the dilatation $\\sigma_{p,q,n}$ and the group $\\mathrm{Aut}_{\\mathbb{C}}(X_{p,q,n})$, see \\cite{MJ11}. \\end{ex}",

In the affine setting, say $X=\\mathrm{Spec}(A)$ and $Y=\\mathrm{Spec}(A/I)$ for some ideal $I\\subset A$, $D(X,Y)$ is the spectrum of the sub-algebra $A[t]$-algebra \\[ A[\\frac{(I,t)}{t}]\\cong\\sum_{n}I^{n}t^{-n}\\subset A[t,t^{-1}]. \\] The composition $f:D(X,Y)\\to\\mathbb{A}_{S}^{1}$ of the dilatation morphism $\\sigma:D(X,Y)\\to X\\times_{S}\\mathbb{A}_{S}^{1}$ with the projection $\\mathrm{p}_{2}:X\\times_{S}\\mathbb{A}_{S}^{1}\\to\\mathbb{A}_{S}^{1}$ is a flat morphism restricting to the trivial bundle $X\\times_{S}(\\mathbb{A}_{S}^{1}\\setminus\\{0\\}_{S})$ over $\\mathbb{A}_{S}^{1}\\setminus\\{0\\}_{S}$ and whose fiber over $\\{0\\}_{S}$ equals the normal cone $N_{Y/X}=\\mathrm{Spec}(\\bigoplus_{n\\geq0}I^{n}/I^{n+1})$ of the closed embedding $Y\\hookrightarrow X$ (see Proposition \\ref{exceptional divisor}). For regular immersions $Y\\hookrightarrow X$ between smooth schemes of dimension $n$ and $m$ over a field $k$, the deformation space $D(X,Y)$ \\'etale locally looks like the deformation space \\[ \\mathrm{Spec}(k[x_{1},\\ldots,x_{m}][t][u_{1},\\ldots,u_{m-n}]/(tu_{i}-x_{i})_{i=1,\\ldots,m-n})\\cong\\mathbb{A}_{k}^{m+1} \\] of the immersion of $\\mathbb{A}_{k}^{n}$ as the linear subspace $\\{x_{1}=\\ldots=x_{m-n}=0\\}$ of $\\mathbb{A}_{k}^{m}=\\mathrm{Spec}(k[x_{1},\\ldots,x_{m}])$.\\\\ Deformation spaces of closed immersions between smooth affine $\\mathbb{C}$-varieties provide an endless source of smooth affine $\\mathbb{C}$-varieties whose analytifications are contractible smooth manifolds: \\begin{ex} Given a smooth affine $\\mathbb{C}$-variety $X$ such that $X^{\\mathrm{an}}$ is contractible and a smooth subvariety $Y\\subset X$ such that the induced inclusion $Y^{\\mathrm{an}}\\subset X^{\\mathrm{an}}$ is a topological homotopy equivalence, Theorem \\ref{thm:Kaliman-Zaidenberg-MainThm} implies that the analytification of the deformation space $D(X,Y)$ is a contractible smooth manifold. For instance, the deformation spaces $D(\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{3},S_{p,q})\\subset\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{5}$ of the tom Dieck - Petrie surfaces $S_{p,q}$ of Example \\ref{exa:.-tom-Dieck-Petrie-surfaces} are smooth affine $\\mathbb{C}$-varieties of dimension $4$ whose analytifications are all diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^{8}$. In the same way, for every Koras-Russell threefold $X_{p,q,n}\\subset\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{4}$ in Example \\ref{exa:-KR-threefolds}, the deformation space \\[ D(\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{4},X_{p,q,n})\\cong\\{tu=x^{n}y+z^{p}+w^{q}+x\\}\\subset\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{6} \\] is a smooth affine $\\mathbb{C}$-variety whose analytification is diffeomorphic to $\\mathbb{R}^{10}$. It is not known whether these deformation spaces are algebraically isomorphic to affine spaces. \\end{ex} More general versions of Kaliman and Zaidenberg techniques allow to fully describe the singular homology of the analytification of the deformation space $D(\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{n},Z)$ of a smooth hypersurface $Z=Z(p)=\\mathrm{Spec}(\\mathbb{C}[x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}]/(p))$ of $\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{n}$ in terms of that of the analytification of $Z$, namely \\begin{propo}[{\\cite[Proposition 4.1]{KZ99}}] \\label{prop:Homology-type-Def-space}For a smooth hypersurface $Z\\subset\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{n}$, $D(\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{n},Z)^{\\mathrm{an}}$ is simply connected and the inclusion $N_{Z/\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{n}}\\hookrightarrow D(\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{n},Z)$ induces an isomorphism of reduced homology groups $\\tilde{H}_{*}(D(\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{n},Z)^{\\mathrm{an}};\\mathbb{Z})\\cong\\tilde{H}_{*-2}(Z^{\\mathrm{an}};\\mathbb{Z})$.

      "content": "^{1}$-homotopy theory} The possibility to import Kaliman and Zaidenberg techniques in the framewok of Morel-Voevodsky $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-homotopy theory of schemes \\cite{MV99} has focused quite a lot of attention recently, especially in the direction of the construction of $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-contractible smooth affine varieties, motivated in part by possible applications to the Zariski Cancellation Problem, see \\cite{AO21} and the reference therein for a survey. Very informally, one views in this context smooth schemes over a fixed base field $k$ as analogous to topological manifolds, with the affine line $\\mathbb{A}_{k}^{1}$ playing the role of the unit interval, and consider the corresponding homotopy category. More rigorously, the $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-homotopy category $\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathbb{A}^{1}}(k)$ of $k$-schemes is defined as the left Bousfield localization of the injective Nisnevich-local model structure on the category of simplicial presheaves of sets on the category $\\mathrm{Sm}_{k}$ of smooth $k$-schemes, with respect to the class of maps generated by projections from the affine line $\\mathcal{X}\\times_{k}\\mathbb{A}_{k}^{1}\\to\\mathcal{X}$. Isomorphisms in the homotopy category $\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathbb{A}^{1}}(k)$ are called $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-\\emph{weak equivalences}, and a smooth $k$-scheme $X$ is called $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-\\emph{contractible} if the structure morphism $X\\to\\mathrm{Spec}(k)$ is an isomorphism in $\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathbb{A}^{1}}(k)$. \\vspace{0.1cm} The affine space $\\mathbb{A}_{k}^{n}$ is by definition $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-contractible. Since the analytification of an $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-contractible smooth $\\mathbb{C}$-variety is a contractible smooth manifold, smooth algebraic $\\mathbb{C}$-varieties with contractible analytifications provided conversely a first natural framework to seek for interesting $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-contractible affine varieties non isomorphic to affine spaces. A first step in this direction was accomplished by Hoyois, Krishna and {\\O}stv{\\ae}r \\cite[Theorem 4.2]{HKO16} who used the underlying geometry associated to the dilatations morphisms $\\sigma_{p,q,n}:X_{p,q,n}\\to\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{3}$ to verify that the Koras-Russell threefolds of Example \\ref{exa:-KR-threefolds} were $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-contractible possibly up to a finite number of $\\mathbb{P}^{1}$-suspensions, in the sense that for some $n\\geq0$, the suspension $(X_{p,q,n},o)\\wedge(\\mathbb{P}^{1})^{\\wedge n}$ is an $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-contractible object in $\\mathrm{H}_{\\mathbb{A}^{1}}(\\mathbb{C})$, where here, $X_{p,q,n}\\subset\\mathbb{A}_{\\mathbb{C}}^{4}$ is considered as a pointed smooth $\\mathbb{C}$-scheme with distinguished point $o=(0,0,0,0)$. \\vspace{0.1cm} These first constructions motivated a more systematic study to obtain $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-homotopic analogues of Kaliman and Zaidenberg's topological comparison results for affine modifications. The best counterparts of Theorem \\ref{thm:Kaliman-Zaidenberg-MainThm} and Corollary \\ref{cor:Main-cor-Top} available so far are the following: \\begin{thm}[{\\cite[Theorem 2.17]{DP019}}] \\label{thm:A1-Homotopical-KZ}Let $(X,D,Z)$ be a triple in $\\mathrm{Sm}_{k}$ where $D$ is a Cartier divisor on $X$ and $Z\\subset D$ is a closed subscheme and let $\\sigma:\\tilde{X}=\\mathrm{Bl_{D}^{Z}X\\to X}$ be the dilatation of $X$ along $D$ with center at $Z$. Assume that the following conditions are satisfied: (i) The supports of $D$ and of the exceptional divisor $E$ of $\\sigma$ are irreducible; (ii) The closed immersion $Z\\hookrightarrow D$ is an $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-weak equivalence. \\noindent Then there is a naturally induced $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-weak equivalence $\\Sigma_{s}\\sigma:\\Sigma_{s}\\tilde{X}\\to\\Sigma_{s}X$ between the simplicial $1$-suspensions of $\\tilde{X}$ and $X$ respectively. In particular, if $X$ is $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-contractible then $\\Sigma_{s}\\tilde{X}$ is $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-contractible. Moreover, a stronger conclusion holds in the reverse direction: if $\\tilde{X}$ is $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-contractible then $X$ is $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-contractible. \\end{thm} \\begin{cor} \\label{cor:DefSpace-A1-Cor}Let $i:Y\\hookrightarrow X$ be a closed immersion between $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-contractible smooth $k$-schemes. Then the simplicial $1$-suspension $\\Sigma_{s}D(X,Y)$ of the deformation space $D(Y,X)$ of $Y$ in $X$ is $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-contractible. \\end{cor} In contrast with the results of subsection \\ref{subsec:classical-top} which can be applied to possibly singular triples $(X,D,Z)$, Theorem \\ref{thm:A1-Homotopical-KZ} and its corollary fundamentally depend on smoothness hypotheses. In particular, Theorem \\ref{thm:A1-Homotopical-KZ} is not applicable to tom Dieck -Petrie surfaces and Koras-Russell threefolds over $\\mathbb{C}$ and their natural generalization over other fields. It was nevertheless verified in \\cite{DF18} by different geometric methods that over any base field $k$ of characteristic zero, the Koras-Russell threefolds $X_{p,q,n}=\\{x^{n}y+z^{p}+w^{q}+x=0\\}$ are indeed all $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-contractible. These provide in turn when combined with Theorem \\ref{thm:A1-Homotopical-KZ} and Corollary \\ref{cor:DefSpace-A1-Cor} the building blocks for the construction of many other new examples of smooth affine $k$-varieties whose simplicial $1$-suspensions are $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-contractible, among which some can be further verified by additional methods to be genuinely $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-contractible, see \\cite[Section 4]{DP019}. \\vspace{0.1cm} A more detailed re-reading of the notion of deformation to the normal cone of a closed immersion $Y\\hookrightarrow X$ between smooth $k$-schemes gives rise to a notion of ``parametrized'' deformation space over a smooth base $k$-scheme $W$, which is defined as a dilatation of the scheme $Y\\times_{k}W$ with appropriate center, see \\cite[Construction 2.1.2]{ADO21}. This leads to the following counterpart and extension of Proposition \\ref{prop:Homology-type-Def-space} in the $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-homotopic framework: \\begin{thm}[{\\cite[Theorem 2]{ADO21}}] \\label{thm:-Deformation=00003Dsuspension} Let $X$ be a smooth $k$-scheme, let $\\pi:X\\to\\mathbb{A}_{k}^{n}$ be a smooth morphism with a section $s$. Assume that $\\pi|_{\\pi^{-1}(\\mathbb{A}_{k}^{n}\\setminus\\{0\\})}:\\pi^{-1}(\\mathbb{A}_{k}^{n}\\setminus\\{0\\})\\to\\pi^{-1}(\\mathbb{A}_{k}^{n}\\setminus\\{0\\})$ is an $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-weak equivalence. Then there exists an induced pointed $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-weak equivalence \\[ (X,s(0))\\sim(\\mathbb{P}^{1})^{\\wedge n}\\wedge(\\pi^{-1}(0),s(0)). \\] In particular, the deformation space $D(X,Y)$ of a closed immersion $(Y,\\star)\\hookrightarrow(X,\\star)$ between pointed smooth $k$-schemes is $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-weakly equivalent to $\\mathbb{P}^{1}\\wedge(Y,\\star)$. \\end{thm} \\begin{ex} Let $Q_{2n}\\subset\\mathbb{A}_{k}^{2n+1}=\\mathrm{Spec}(k[u_{1},\\ldots,u_{n},v_{1},\\ldots,v_{n},z])$ be the smooth $2n$-dimensional split quadric with equation $\\sum_{i=1}^{n}u_{i}v_{i}=z(z+1)$. The projection $\\pi=\\mathrm{pr}_{u_{1},\\ldots,u_{,n}}:Q_{2n}\\to\\mathbb{A}_{k}^{n+1}$ is a smooth morphism restricting to a Zariski locally trivial $\\mathbb{A}^{n}$-bundle over $\\mathbb{A}_{k}^{n}\\setminus\\{0\\},$ hence to an $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-weak equivalence over $\\mathbb{A}_{k}^{n}\\setminus\\{0\\}$, and having the morphism \\[ s:\\mathbb{A}_{k}^{n}\\to Q_{2n},\\,(u_{1},\\ldots,u_{n})\\mapsto(u_{1},\\ldots,u_{n},0,\\ldots,0,0) \\] as a natural section. On the other hand, $\\pi^{-1}(0)$ is $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-weakly equivalent to the disjoint union of $s(0)$ and of the point $p=(0,\\ldots,0\\ldots,-1)$. Theorem \\ref{thm:-Deformation=00003Dsuspension} thus renders the conclusion that $(Q_{2n},s(0))$ is $\\mathbb{A}^{1}$-weakly equivalent to $(\\mathbb{P}^{1})^{\\wedge n}\\wedge (p\\sqcup s(0))\\sim(\\mathbb{P}^{1})^{\\wedge n}$. In particular $Q_{2n}$ provides a smooth $k$-scheme model of the motivic sphere $(\\mathbb{P}^{1})^{\\wedge n}=S^{n}\\wedge\\mathbb{G}_{m,k}^{\\wedge n}$. \\end{ex} \\bigbreak\\bigbreak \\noindent \\par \\noindent \\noindent IMB UMR5584, CNRS, Universit\u00e9 de Bourgogne Franche-Comt\u00e9, Dijon, France \\par \\noindent E-mail address: \\texttt{Adrien.Dubouloz@u-bourgogne.fr} \\noindent \\medskip \\noindent \\noindent Universit\\'e Clermont Auvergne, CNRS, LMBP, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France \\par \\noindent E-mail address: \\texttt{arnaud.mayeux@uca.fr} \\medskip \\noindent \\noindent Institut Montpelli\u00e9rain Alexander Grothendieck, Universit\u00e9 de Montpellier.
